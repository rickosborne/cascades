# Buying Time

“How much longer can we stay up here?”

“Excuse me?” Simon retorted.

“I am certain there is pressure switch on the bomb.
It will explode if we descend.”

“How do you know?”

_Trial and error._

“How I know is not important.
I know.”
I looked each of them in the eyes.
“Look at me.
Do I seem unsure?”

Lawrence picked up a clipboard and pencil.
While I stared the others down, he did the math.

“An extra fifty minutes.
Maybe fifty-five.
Then we’re in the Atlantic.”

“No, then we’re in pieces.
The bomb is positioned to take out the avionics to the tail.”

Pamela gasped and ran out of the cockpit.

Lawrence reached down to the panel marked RADIO and hovered his finger over a switch.
“I’m calling this in.”

“I think you should.
Maybe they can be helpful.
But before you do, do either of you know if there’s an access panel to the rear luggage compartment?”
I pointed at the panel in the floor where I stood.
“Like this one?”

“Not in a 707,” said Lawrence.
“That one just gets you to the electronics and air handling systems.
There isn’t a trap for either luggage compartment.
But it can’t hurt to double-check.”
He picked up a large binder and thumbed through it.
He found the page he was looking for, traced his finger along it, and shook his head.

A whispered curse escaped my lips causing Simon to squint at me.
I bit my thumb and talked to myself.

“We can’t disarm it because we can’t get to it.
When it blows we’ll spin, roll, and die.
We—”

Simon snorted, interrupting me.

“Yes?” I said, with a complete lack of deference that I never would have considered before.

“Do you have any idea how hard it is to spin, much less roll, a 707?”
He folded his hands across his chest and looked between me and Lawrence.

“When the bomb explodes, not if,” I said, speaking in a calm and cool voice to Lawrence, “the aircraft will go into a flat spin.”

I held out my left hand and made a twisting motion.
I knew they both knew what a flat spin was, but I needed them to realize that I did, too.

“Between thirty and ninety seconds later we will roll.”

My hand, kinked at an angle to my arm, twisted down at the thumb and up at the pinky.

“We’ll roll for about ten seconds before the port wing shears off from the stress.”

I curled my pinky and ring finger into my fist, flipping it over to continue the rolling motion.
When my hand came up, only my middle finger was still out, directed at Simon.

“At which point you’re flying a very expensive lawn dart.”

The capped detonator was cool in my other hand.
They didn’t know about it, and now I was sure I didn’t want to tell them.

“Call it in,” I said to Lawrence.
“I have a backup plan.”

I walked out of the cockpit, furious at Simon for being such a jerk.

If I was honest with myself, I was furious not just at him, but at the situation.
This was my sixth time through the same events and I still hadn’t solved anything.

I’m not a religious person, but nor do I dismiss the concept of a higher power.
My grandmother’s faith was extremely important to her, and to this day I respect those beliefs.

Whether God, or Mother Earth, or the universe, or just random chance, _something_ had set me on this path.
Something had set up these loops, allowing me to learn and fix things.

But I haven’t _fixed_ anything.
I’ve been at this for, what, forty-something hours straight?
My head is throbbing, my stomach is empty, and _I can’t fix it_.
