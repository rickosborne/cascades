# Sandstorm

Shaking my head to clear it, I stuck this landing by reaching across the cart and grabbing Terry's arm.
He cocked his head at me as I gasped for breath.

"I've been doing this backwards," I told him.
"That doesn't make sense yet, but it will."

I moved to the intercom and called the cockpit.
Simon answered.

"Captain, we have a sandstorm."

"That's not funny.
Who is this?
Reserve girl?"

"Lily.
I'm not kidding."
I cupped my hand over the mouthpiece and said, "There's a bomb.
Get us on the ground now.
Squawk 7700."
I switched off and hung up the phone before he could argue.

Terry went rigid, color draining from his face.
I moved past him to the coat closet, going straight to the green cashmere coat on the far right.
I shrugged it on, feeling its weight on my shoulders.
Kneeling, I leaned forward to whisper into Harold Sr.'s ear.

"Harold Grant.
I need you and your son to quietly get up and stand back in the tail."
His head whipped around as I put my hand on his on the armrest.
"It's an emergency, but you must be calm about it.
As you go, flip your armrests all the way up."

He cocked his head but nodded, then turned to whisper to his son.
I stood up and stepped back into the galley to talk to Terry, again leaning in to whisper in his ear.

"The woman in 27A has a bomb in her luggage and a remote detonator in her purse."
He pulled away from me, about to object, but I pulled him back.
"She won't detonate it, trust me.
But she also has a knife on her.
When I tackle her," he jerked away, making me drag him back, "when I tackle her I'm going to try to get you her purse.
It's on her lap—we need to get it away from her, okay?"

The Grant men walked past me toward the lavatories.

"Thank you," I mouthed, making an "around the corner" gesture with my hand.

The floor pitched as the aircraft banked into a tight turn.

"It's time," I said to Terry.
"Ready?"

"No!" he said in a loud whisper.

"Doesn't matter.
It's got to happen now before we descend."

I kicked my shoes off, turned and ran around the corner, and dove into row 27.
Instead of going face first, I rotated and landed as if to sit in her lap.
I grabbed at her purse with my left hand, attempting to pull it out of the way as I landed.
It didn't come away clean—she managed to catch not of the straps with her own left hand.
My back slammed into her chest, catching that arm against the wall.
I jammed my feet into the cracks between the row 26 seats, leveraging back into her with all of my strength.

Her right arm was trapped between us, so I used my own right elbow to try to keep it from escaping.
I managed to get both hands around the straps on the purse and yanked while slamming my head back into hers.
I saw stars, but the purse came loose.

I heard one of the passengers scream, then another.

I tossed the purse to Terry, screaming at him over the passengers.

"The outer sections have zippered compartments!"
Irene struggled behind me, so I slammed my head back into hers, trying to wedge it into the corner.
"One of them has an expensive fountain pen!"

Her struggle intensified, so I head-butted her a third time and a fourth.
I heard her head slam into the wall on the third, then felt it rebound from the wall on the fourth.
Her struggling ceased and her arms went limp.
My own brain was fuzzy and it took a second to clear.

"I've got it!" Terry exclaimed.

"Give it!"
I held out my hand to him.

The pitch of the turn leveled and my stomach dropped.

Terry snapped the pen into my palm and I went to work on it.
The cap and nib flew off, the tube sliding out into my hand.
I unscrewed the cap and looked at the switch.
It was set to the red ‘P' position.
Twisting it farther clockwise didn't do anything.

I held my breath and pushed the button.
Nothing happened.
Taking that as the best possible sign, I replaced the cap on the detonator and tucked it into one of the inner coat pockets.

My head rang from the impacts and from the loop headache.
I sat there, half on top of Irene, panting.
I saw Pamela come rushing through the curtain into Coach.

"Was that it?" Terry asked.

"I think so, but it will take a few minutes to be sure.
Help me up?"

He reached out and pulled me off of Irene.
She wasn't completely unconscious, her arms moving weakly to her head.

Remembering the knife, I dove back down between the seats and grabbed for her calf.
The knife was there and snapped free easily.
She was too out of it and didn't seem to notice.
I got back off the floor and held up my pearl-handled prize to show Terry, angling myself so most of the passengers couldn't see it.

"Crikey," he said.
"How did you know?"

"Long story," I exhaled.
"But we're not done yet."

I looked up to where I knew the Michelsons were sitting.
They were both looking back at me.
"Doctors, I could use your help."
I beckoned them toward us.
To Pamela, I said "sandstorm" and saw her jaw clench.

Waving my arm above the rest of the passengers, I kept one eye on the slow-moving Irene.
"Everyone else please remain in your seats.
We'll explain shortly."

Alan and Edna got up and hurried back to us.

"Doctor," I said looking at Alan, "I need to make sure she's okay, but she's dangerous and I need her to stay down.
Can you do that?"

He stared at me and swallowed.

"Yes," he said, turning to his new patient.

"Doctor," this time to Edna, "I need you to help someone else.
Follow me, please?"

We slipped past Pamela, moving along the rows to keep people seated.
The engine pitch changed and my stomach dropped a second time.
I kept waiting for the boom, but it didn't come.
We arrived at row 18 and stopped.
Ernest, already craning to look at us, stared at me.

"Ernest, I need to help Mary.
Those pills are going to kill her.
Move, please."

"What?
You can't be—"

"Ernest!" I growled, grabbing his lapels leaning back to haul him to his feet.
"We don't have time for this!
Move!"

Mary and Jennifer stared up at the three of us.
I bodily pulled Ernest out of the row and pushed him through the curtain into Smoking.

"She took some bad pills," I said to Edna, "just a few minutes ago.
Can you take her back to the lavatories and help her get them out?"

Reaching out my hand, I helped Mary to her feet.
She reached out a hand to touch my face.

"Are you …?"
She tried to ask something, but couldn't collect herself enough to do so.
"No," she said, turning to follow Edna down the aisle.

A passenger toward the rear yelled, "what's going on?" which was echoed by several others.

Pamela and Terry stared at me, as did the Grants and everyone else who could see me.
Calm and collected, I held up one finger in front of my lips for silence.
Pulling the curtain to Smoking aside, I indicated to Ernest that he should sit back down.
I shrugged out of the coat and laid it across my clasped hands.

"I apologize for the excitement," I said in a voice loud enough that everyone would hear me.
"I will explain.
Bear with me for just a few more minutes."

Not giving them a chance to object, I strode up the aisle, through first class, and knocked on the cockpit door.

"It's Lily.
I'm alone."

The door unlocked and opened.

"Are we landing?"

"What the hell is—" Simon began.

"I'll explain, but first: are we landing?"

"Yes," said Lawrence.
"PDX."

"How long?"

"Fifteen minutes."

"Okay, the short version then.
One passenger has a bomb in the rear luggage compartment.
We've disarmed and subdued her."

"Jesus," exhaled Simon.

"A second passenger," I continued, "has been poisoned.
I've got a doctor looking at her, but she's going to need an ambulance on the ground.
Make it two—the lady with the bomb got banged up."

Lawrence asked, "Is there a chance the bomb could go off?"

"I don't think so."
I pulled the silver detonator tube out of the coat pocket.
"I got the detonator from her.
The bomb has some kind of air pressure switch, but I think I disarmed it.
It would have gone off by now."

Lawrence nodded, staring at his instruments.
"That will have to be good enough for now.
Is there anything else we should know?"

"No.
Thank you, Captain."

As I exited the cockpit I heard his voice come over the PA.

"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the pilot speaking.
We've got a medical emergency and are rerouting to Portland.
We're already descending and will touch down in about fifteen minutes.
Don't worry, the folks on the ground will get your tickets sorted out and we'll get you to Miami as soon as we can.
For now we need you to get secured so we can all land safely."

The FSB indicator flashed on with a ding! as the PA clicked off.

I walked back into Coach to a round of applause.
Surprised, I stopped just inside the curtain.
I smiled and waved as I looked down the aisle to see Terry and Pamela heading toward me.

"I need to get back to First," Pamela said, scooting around me, "but I want the whole story later."

"Sure thing," I told her.
I asked Terry, "Can you make sure everyone is buckled in?
I need to check on them," I nodded to the clump of people standing in the tail.

The applause died, but people said thank yous as I passed them in the aisle.

"Mr. Grant and Mr. Grant," I said as I approached them.
"Thank you for your cooperation.
More than you know.
Would you mind taking the Michelsons' seats in row 23?"

The two men nodded, Junior speaking up in a low whisper.

"Is there really a bomb?"

"It's been taken care of," I offered instead of a direct confirmation.
"We'll be landing shortly and you should get buckled in."

Junior looked like he wanted to ask more, but Senior put a hand on his shoulder and walked him past me.

"Thank you again," I said.

Moaning sounds came from the lavatory.
I had a pretty good idea of what they were.
I stepped back and stuck my head around the corner.
Dr. Alan Michelson sat in 27B next to Irene, the armrests back to their normal down position.
I saw that Irene's hands were strapped to her armrests with a pair of leather belts.

"Is she going to be okay?"

Alan looked up at me.
"She'll live, but she may have a concussion.
She'll need an ambulance."

My hand went to the back of my skull, still tender.

"I've asked the pilots to arrange one.
Do you need anything for her right now?"

Alan pointed to a small black leather bag on the seat next to him.

"I've got my bag, but thank you.
How's the elderly woman?"

"I'm just about to find out."

I walked back to the lavatory, where the moaning had reduced to more of a whimper.
Edna was helping Mary to a sitting position on the toilet.

"Doctor," I said softly.
Both women looked up at me.
Mary's eyes were still
vague and wandering.
"Mrs. Hamilton."
I looked to Edna.
"Will she be okay?"

"We got something up, so we'll see.
Do you know what she took?"

"Sorry, no.
I could get the bottle, but I don't think what's on the label is what's in the pills.
Would you like me to?"

"Not now, but we'll need it when we land."

"Speaking of which, can I move you ladies out to the jump seats?
I'd like to get you strapped in."

I flipped down the seats and picked up my textbook.
Each of us reaching into the lavatory, Edna and I got Mary to her feet and shuffled her into the jump seats.
Mary picked at the book in my arm while we buckled her in, like a baby grasping for its bottle.
I pulled it away from her and tossed it into one of the empty storage compartments on the wall.
Mary was holding her stomach when I turned back.

"Don't … feel …"

I knelt next to her, brushing her cheek with the back of my fingers.

"I know.
We're going to make it better, I promise."
I looked to Edna.
"Is there anything I can get you for her?"

"No, thank you."

Nodding, I walked back to the galley.
I turned the corner to find Jennifer Keats standing there, staring at me.

"You need to get back to your seat, Ms. Keats."
Moving back, I spread an arm to show her out.

She squinted at me, as I remembered her doing however many loops ago.

"I will, but one thing: you need to find me when we land."

"The airline will—"

She chopped a hand to cut me off.

"Not the airline.
You."

"I'm sorry, I don't—"

Her voice came out a whisper, and I didn't think I'd heard her right.
"How many times?"

"Excuse me?"
My hand dropped to my side.

Jennifer leaned in, whispering.

"How many times did that take to get right?"
