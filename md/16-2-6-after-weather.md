# After Weather

The weather came and went, loud and angry but not violent.
I noted the time of the clocks when the _ding!_ Sounded and the FSB light winked out: 12:55 and 3:55.

Pamela and I didn't say much to each other this time through the storm.
I gave her more details about my interactions with Dearborn, Hamilton, and Keats, but as she hadn't experienced it herself this time she was far less concerned.
She'd gone back to her book with a "there's nothing we can do about it now, anyway" and the rest of the time passed in silence.

I also learned that she was a fast reader.
In the two hours we were next to each other she got through another third of her book, which looked to total on the near side of 500 pages.
If left to her own devices she would finish that book before she had to get up and start making the morning coffee.

Once again I had no idea how that could possibly be useful information.

Terry, I discovered, had given up on his newspaper and had his paperback instead.

_That's an interesting change._

He'd almost vivisected the newspaper in the last loop he'd spent up front.
This time the newspaper looked as if it had been skimmed, not read front to back.
In loop zero he'd read his paperback through the storm and most of the pre-dawn hours.
I hadn't been paying enough attention to remember how far he'd gotten, but this looked similar enough to that loop.

Had his position within the airplane made that much of a difference in how he kept himself busy?
Or had I done or said something that led to that difference?

Or did Terry know we were looping?
Like me?
But he was doing a really good job of hiding it?

My eyes widened in sudden realization: I hadn't seen Terry at the end of either loop.
A half-dozen scenarios flitted across my mind's eye: Terry by the rear exit, unconscious from a head wound.
Terry, like me, caught unaware in a lavatory, but stuck behind a jammed door and banging to get free.
Terry passed out from lack of oxygen in one of the passenger rows because he'd been trying to get masks on everyone else.

And worst: Terry getting caught in the first explosion, blown out the gaping hole, and falling limp to the Earth below.

I replayed the aftermath of explosion two: had I seen Terry and Pamela come back through the curtains as she and I had done after the first?
No.
I'd been focused on the hole, but I think I would have noticed that.

Come to think of it, I hadn't heard either of them over the PA.
The second explosion had only been followed by passengers screaming and the sucking roar of the wind—no commanding or comforting flight attendants to the rescue.
What had happened to Pamela and Terry at the end of that loop?

Was there a non-Shatner way I could figure out if Terry knew?
Or worse, if Terry had anything to do with the explosion?

A low-grade headache set up shop just above the nape of my neck.
I'd had a headache both other times through.
Well, that and the cranium-splitter that came on each time just before I looped.

_That's a good point._

It could be that my headache is linked to my looping, but right now it felt like a normal headache.
Well, like I said I rarely get headaches, but on the occasions when I had they weren't too different.
I found the galley stash of aspirin and tossed back a pair of pills.

"Everything all right?" Terry asked from behind me.

"Just a small headache.
I'm going to grab some food from up front so the aspirin doesn't tear up my stomach.
Want anything?"

"Nah.
I had my dinner during the storm."

_Huh.
I don't remember that from loop zero._

"Be right back."

Pamela was in the First Class galley, picking her way into a sandwich.
I caught her mid-bite so she gave me a half-wave for a greeting.

"I was just thinking the same thing," I told her.

High Desert Air may be a bargain basement airline, but they try to do right by us.
It was one of the upsides to working for an airline owned and run by pilots and not suits.
Even on flights without meal service there is always something provided for the flight attendants.

Sandwiches were common, though we might get an upgrade if the catering service at the departure airport was that infrequent combination of both good and cheap.
Some of us will pack a lunch in case the offerings aren't great, but most of us will eat almost anything that isn't junk food.
I think I mentioned that flight attendants and free food go hand-in-hand, right?

The selection tonight was a turkey sandwich, a turkey sandwich, or if I wanted to go wild, a turkey sandwich.
As Thanksgiving was just over two weeks ago I shouldn't be surprised.
It's a safe assumption that any lines I pick up between now and New Years will probably have the exact same options.

I'm not complaining.
A free, decent sandwich is a free, decent sandwich.

There was also an extra salad container in the fridge, but a quick glance around the galley didn't find a twin for it, meaning this salad was likely Pamela's.

Sandwich obtained, I mirrored Pamela's half-wave and walked back to the aft galley.
I thought back to what I remembered from the previous loop: there should be two men in Smoking who are awake, along with Mr. Duchesne and the businesswoman in 27A.
I saw that I was right, though I had forgotten the fine details.
One man was doing a crossword, the other reading, and Mr. Duchesne was returning to his seat from the lavatory.
The businesswoman looked up and smiled as I passed.

It occurred to me that I hadn't bothered to look up her name on the manifest.

On a whim, I dropped off my sandwich on the galley counter and poked my head around the wall of the coat closet.
The woman caught the motion and looked up at me.

"Can I get you anything?"
As the father and son between us were sleeping, I said it just above a whisper, exaggerating the words with my mouth and pointing between myself and the galley.

The woman considered, then nodded.
She held up a finger, pointed to herself and then the aisle, making the scissor motion for walking.
I nodded and stepped back into the galley, throwing my sandwich into a cupboard to get it out of sight.
Most people on normal schedules wouldn't think about eating at 4am, but you could never be too careful.

"Oh, that's nice," the woman said as she stepped toward me stretching.

Her Southern accent made it come out _naahs_.
"What time is it?"

This is a tricky question to answer.
We're never sure if passengers want the departure time zone, arrival time zone, or in rare cases the time zone we were flying through at the time.

Flight crew develop a view of time that most people would probably think crazy.
We exist in both the departure and arrival time zones simultaneously.
It's somehow normal to accept that it is both times at once.
Our brains can hear either and just translate into the one that makes the most sense for the context.

Given her accent, I assumed Eastern was how she thought of home.

"Just after four."
The next question was obvious, even without the looping, so I answered it before she asked.
"It's a bit less than three hours to go."

"What time is our wake-up call?"

A magnet shaped like a cactus held a piece of paper to the galley bulkhead behind me.
That paper had our exact schedule, but I knew it by heart.

"We'll turn up the lights two hours from now, around 6:15.
That will give everyone a chance," I flicked my head toward the lavatories, "before we start our descent at a quarter to seven."

"Oooo," she crooned as she turned and walked aft, "I should beat the rush.
Pardon me a moment."

She was dressed in a merlot silk blouse and black tuxedo pant combo that was nice enough to be a little out of place in the aft-end of Coach.
She had a light tan leather purse snugged up under her left shoulder that looked large enough to be uncomfortable.
Terry, still in the jump seat working on his paperback, exchanged hellos with her as she chose a lavatory.
His eyes didn't linger on her objectively nice outfit or form.

I stepped out of the galley and snuck a glance at the briefcase now occupying her seat.
It was a deep cabernet leather, oversized even for a man, with polished brass accents and locks that looked as expensive as I'd expect from her outfit.
The woman couldn't have been much more than 5'4", so when she walked it probably looked like she was carrying a steamer trunk.

She looked to be in her late twenties, maybe a few years older than me.

Being a flight attendant also does weird things to your head when it comes to how you think about other people.
On the one hand you see so many people every day, each with their own story, needs, and desires, that you can't help but appreciate the sheer diversity of human existence.
On the other hand you also see just how easy it is for stereotypes to be true, so it gets hard to not put people into buckets.
Some of us, myself included, turn it into a kind of game, inventing back-stories for the passengers.

This woman didn't fit into any of those nice, easy buckets.
Each thing about her was a contradiction.
She had an air of maturity and politeness that I associated with women a decade older.
Her briefcase was nice, but clearly meant for a man.
Her clothing was nice, but I thought back to that coat.
The bright avocado green would look awful with her dark red blouse, not to mention the incongruous briefcase.
And while it was rare but not exceptional that someone in Coach stayed awake through an overnighter, I can't think of the last time it was because they were working.
That kind of thing was far more common in First Class.

I couldn't figure out her story.

On another whim, I stepped across the aisle and pulled out a blanket from storage, putting it down on the counter next to me.

The woman stepped out of the lavatory and walked over to the exit door.

A passenger walking up to the exit door mid-flight is to a flight attendant what a suspect reaching into his jacket is to a cop.
Flight attendants and cops both know that the vast majority of people aren't stupid enough to do anything unexpected, but that twist in the gut will always be there.

She didn't do anything crazy, just put her hands to the sides of the small window and pressed her face to it.

"Huh."
She said.
"Not much to see."

The combination of the window's tiny size, the darkness outside, and the lights from behind her meant that all she'd have in view would be her own reflection.

"What's keeping you up all night?"
I asked when she returned.

"I have a tight deadline for work."

"Can I make you some coffee?"

The woman considered the question, then said "that would be nice, thank you."

"It'll just take a minute to brew," I said as I turned into the galley and went fishing for the tin of coffee grounds. "What do you do, if I may ask?"

"I do research and legwork for contract negotiations."

Impressed, I paused and blinked.
"That sounds intense.
What does it involve?"

"Too many late nights, I'm afraid."
She chuckled, then continued.
"Let's say you're a company that wants to acquire something from another company.
It might be equipment or technology or even people.
You would hire me to look into the best way to go about it.
I would tell you to make an open cash offer, or to go through a third party, or maybe even to use the legal system."

I punched the button to start the coffee machine and turned back to her.

"Like due diligence?"

The woman shrugged, noncommittal.

"I'm usually involved a step or two before official due diligence.
I make sure it's worth going down that particular road at all."

"Oh, so you don't work for a law firm?"

"I'm an independent contractor.
It's just me."

"How do you like that?"

"Being a contractor?"

"Working for yourself."

She paused again to consider, looking to the ceiling.
The coffee gurgled behind me.

"It's hard work, and not as regular as I would like.
The industry is mostly men, so I have to work twice as hard to seem half as valuable.
When a client comes along I have to work to show them I'm worth my rates."
She smiled, more to herself than to me.
"Besides, I don't play well with others.
That's what makes me good at my job."

"You seem perfectly nice to me," I said.
I heard the coffee machine click off and turned to grab a cardboard cup with our stylized HDA logo.

"Why thank you, sugar, you're too sweet."

"What kind of a background do you need for that?" I asked as I poured out her cup.
There was no point in letting this pot cook for the next two hours, so I turned off the machine.

She laughed to herself before answering.

"I'm sure it's probably something like a business or law degree, but I never got one.
An old friend of mine got me into it.
I was hooked after that very first job.
Thanks," she said, taking the cup and holding it to her face with both hands.

"I also thought you might get chilly in that corner."
I put my hand on the blanket I had set out.
"Would you like a blanket?"

Her eyebrows went up in surprise.

"That is so nice of you!
Thank you but not right now."
She held up the cup.
"This will keep me warm enough.
Do you mind if I drink it back here?
I'm not ready to sit back down again."

"Please do.
I'm just going to put this away," I said, lifting the blanket.
She stepped back to let me get to the storage closet.

"How long have you been flying?"

I resumed my place, leaning against the galley counter.

"Six months."

"Is that all?"
Eyebrows arched with the question.
"You're very professional.
It seems like you've been doing this for years."

"Thank you.
My grandmother was a stewardess and she raised me.
I've been in training since I was a baby."

"Tell her I said she's doing a fine job."
She smiled, but it faltered as she caught something in my expression.
I don't have the mask that Pamela does.

"She would have loved to have heard you say that, thank you."

"Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie."

An awkward beat passed when I regained my smile.
It hurt that she was gone, but I had meant what I said.
She'd have beamed to hear those words, and picturing her expression raised my spirits.

The woman spoke first.

"Before I sit down, I did have one more question."

"You're welcome back here as long as you'd like, but go on."

"I have recently acquired a very unladylike vice," she said, pointing to the Smoking section.
"Am I allowed while everyone is still sleeping, or do I need to wait until you turn the lights back on?"

"As long as you are discreet you should be fine."

She nodded, taking the last pull on her coffee before handing the cup back to me.

"It was lovely talking with you, Lily."

"It was mutual."
I winked at her.
"I appreciate the company."

I watched her walk up the aisle, digging in her purse as she did so.
She wasn't watching where she was going and stumbled into one of the rows close to the curtain.
A man turned to face her and I had another gut-twisting moment of panic.
From his thick neck and salt and pepper hair I realized that it was Dearborn.
She made the exaggerated gesticulations of an apology and it looked like Dearborn waved her off.

She'd been lucky—I knew Dearborn was one of only a few people still awake.
It could have gotten ugly if she had woken someone up.

The curtain closed behind the woman and I grabbed for my sandwich, tearing into it.
