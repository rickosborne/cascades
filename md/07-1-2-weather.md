# Weather

I could feel the gentle bank to port just as I stowed the last of the leftover drinks.
I added two miniature bottles of gin by pushing back a half-dozen bottles of rum, which I'd run back from the cart on an earlier trip to the galley when it had become clear we were going to need far more vodka.
Terry had been a Bloody Mary salesman, convincing passengers that the sugar in the rum would keep them up and that the tomato juice was as close as they'd come to dinner service for the evening.
Between his accent and his sense of humor he got away with more irreverence than I thought I could ever pull off.

"What was with the Bloody Marys?"

His mustache gained a conspiratorial smirk and his reply was barely audible.

"The tomato mix is on its way out.
I wanted to get rid of it."

"I hadn't noticed.
Good catch."

A woman in her late forties, who I remembered as being in 15 or 16 E or F, squeezed around Terry to get to the lavatory.
His eyes bulged as she passed and there was a slight hitch as he wiped the condensation off the now-empty ice bucket.
I'd been in that position enough times to know exactly what had happened.
His jaw tightened for an instant, confirming without words.
He moved around the cart, into the entrance to the galley and well out of the path to the aisle.

When the woman came back out of the lavatory I had to suppress a snicker.
It was obvious that the woman had removed her bra.
Terry made a polite smile and nod in her direction, handing me the last of the serviettes from the cart.
The woman didn't so much walk past him in as much as she sauntered, making sure he could see every stretch and slide of fabric against her.
She flicked an eyebrow at me as she passed.

I broke the silence with a whispered "well, then" as I slid the cart into its home beneath the galley counter.

Terry was unreadable—he could have been interested, disgusted, amused, or anything else.
His eyes locked on the same lavatory door the woman had just exited.
He walked over to it and peeked inside.

"Did you think she'd left a mess?" I asked when he rejoined me a moment later.

His response was more exasperated than I was expecting.

"No, worse.
I was worried she'd left me a present."

My eyes widened at the idea.
Who just strips off their bra and then leaves it in a restroom for a guy to find?

"It wouldn't be the first time," he sighed.

Terry looked at the galley and then up the aisle.
I knew that look—he was assessing which he wanted to tackle.
