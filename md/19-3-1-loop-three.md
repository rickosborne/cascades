# Loop Three

_—on._

I caught myself against the cart, gasping.
I gritted my teeth as sensation flooded back to me.
The drum section faded out, though I could feel my heart racing.

Terry stood across from me, eyes wide.

“Everything all right?”

How many times had he asked me that?
I started to answer, but reconsidered.

“I think I need to eat something before we start.
Do you mind if I take a quick minute?”
I asked, tilting my head toward First Class.
As I said it I realized how true it was—I was getting hungrier at the start of each loop.

He looked stunned but shook his head.
I wondered what my reentry looked like from his perspective.

“Can I get you anything?”

He again shook his head without responding.

“Great.
I’ll be right back.”
I turned to go, but looked back.
“Oh, and I think I stocked too much rum.
We should switch it out for vodka and push Bloody Marys.”
