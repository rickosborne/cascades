# Cruising Altitude

The speaker crackled and my ears perked up.
The response was uncontrollable.
Pavlovian.

"Ladies and gentlemen we have reached cruising altitude."

My eyes locked onto the public address speaker on the wall ahead of me while my hands pulled my bookmark from the back of my book and wedged it in at the current page.

"I'm turning off the No Smoking sign in the forward cabin," the _ding!_ chimed over the PA in the same cadence as the man's speech as if just another piece of punctuation in his sentence, "and I'd like everyone to keep in mind that the rear is a smoke-free section. 
I'm also turning off the seat belt sign," another well-timed _ding!_, "so smokers in the rear can come forward as needed. 
As you do, please close the curtains behind you for the comfort of those in the rows closest to the smoking section."

The PA clicked off but no one stood.
From my position behind them all, I could see dozens of heads swivel to look up at similar, vague places, straining to understand the garbled message the pilot's tone of voice indicated would continue.
I have to admit that I only know what he's saying because I've heard it so many times.
There was a burst of static before the pilot's voice continued.

"It looks like we have some weather over the midwest, so we're going to head south for a bit instead of taking our usual direct route. 
It's going to get bumpy in an hour so plan ahead and have that last smoke for the night before then. 
We'll be in the air just over 8 hours tonight, which will put us into Miami shortly after sunrise around seven o'clock tomorrow morning. 
Until then, have a drink, get some sleep, and we'll handle the rest."

I hadn't even unbuckled my seat belt before I heard the next _ding!_, this one in a different tone and accompanied by a small blue light on a panel on the starboard galley wall. 
I stowed my thick textbook in its usual place, wedged into the jump seat's recessed alcove as I closed it. 
I double-checked that my face was on before I peeked around the corner and scanned for a matching blue light above the passengers. 
A few rows back from the smoking section: 18E. 
No one in the area looked frantic, so I made a mental note to follow up after my service prep.

The older gentleman from 21C unbuckled, stood, and shuffled toward me. 
Or, I guessed from the strained look on his face, toward the lavatories behind me. 
I stepped into the galley to get out of his way and was already half-way through making a pot of coffee before my brain caught up with my hands. 
I felt someone's presence behind me and spoke without turning around.

"You want to get 18E?  Or prep for service?"

There was an almost inaudible snort before responding.

"It looks like you've got prep started."
It came out "stah-tid" with the Australian's accent erasing the "r" while drawing out the first syllable. 
"The cart's behind you."
Except it came out "ca-at" and "ya". 
I couldn't help but smile at it.

Another voice came over the PA, this time a woman's.

"Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to do a quick beverage service before we turn out the lights for the evening. 
We know it took longer than anyone liked to get off the ground, so High Desert Air would like to offer adults one complimentary beverage to take the edge off."

There was a small cheer and the background noise in the cabin went up a notch. 

I knew about the offer and had already started loading the cart with tiny bottles of rum, gin, whisky, and vodka. 
HDA didn't have the operating budget to stock the good stuff, nor anything too outside of the norm. 
I doubt the decision to give away what would probably amount to 50 to 75 free alcoholic drinks was easy, but it didn't take a Harvard Business degree to know that losing customers over a two-hour delay on the tarmac was not an option for the already struggling airline.

"We'll bring out the cart in just a moment. 
And like the captain said, if you're going to smoke you should do it now before we hit the weather—the cart's going to make it tricky."

I heard the sound of a dozen seat belts unbuckling at once, followed by several fumbled "excuse me" voices. 
I continued to load the cart on auto-pilot, my awareness focused on my schoolwork. 
The ten minutes between takeoff and cruising altitude hadn't gotten me far into the chapter, and I still couldn't see the path from what I'd read to what I knew my homework was.

_It's a cache priming problem_, I thought as I pulled a bag of ice out of the freezer. 
_There are N passengers, each with a probability P of ordering a drink. 
The range of drink orders is the set O, which includes all combinations of rum R, whiskey W, vodka V, gin G, tonic T, soda water S, cola C, and most important of all: ice I. 
How do you stock the beverage cart B, which is really just a cache, to maximize the orders that can be filled from the cart, minimizing the number of cache misses M—how many times I have to walk back here to the galley to restock the cart—without knowing the drink orders up front?_

Speaking of up front, I knew Pamela would already be in First Class doing exactly that: taking drink orders with her cactus-green HDA notepad and natural brown pencil. 
She could get away with that with her 22 souls. 
Terry and I had Coach and 129 souls—it was just more efficient, and visible, to make a best guess with the cart and restock later.

A throat cleared behind me, followed by an interrogatory "excuse me".
I turned to find a young man—a few years younger than me anyway. 
I seemed to remember him seated somewhere to port in the low teens, in one of the exit rows, maybe?  I made eye contact with him and he immediately looked down. 
His eyes landed on my chest and locked on my name badge before he blushed and looked away. 
I'd seen eyes follow that path for the six months I'd been flying and no longer reacted to it.

"Yes, sir?"

His eyes came back up to my face but bounced around it and the galley wall behind me like a billiard ball.

"Do you, um, I mean of course you do, but," he stammered. 

In the time it took him to get that far, I'd already parsed his accent: Indiana, Illinois, or thereabouts. 
He looked 22, but he sounded more like 17. 
I'd have to card him if he ordered alcohol, even with the free drink offer.

"I mean, um, what's the movie tonight?"
He added a hasty "ma'am?" at the end that made me think he was straight out of an Indiana corn field.

"Sorry, but we won't be offering a film tonight. 
We don't usually offer them on our overnight flights, so the bright screens won't keep anyone up."  I also knew a third of HDA's 707 fleet had busted projection equipment, and fewer in-flight movies meant less money paid out in royalties.

His face dropped, and his eyes did the face-chest-floor skip again. 
He mumbled an awkward "thanks" before turning around and walking back toward his seat. 
But he only got a few steps before he stopped and his shoulders slumped. 
He turned around and stepped back to me.

"Lily?"

My name. 
Here comes the special request.

"Is it okay if we switch seats?"

I stopped scooping ice into the bucket. 
"Is there a problem with your seat?"

He frowned and his eyes met mine for a beat before deflecting to the cart between us.
"My par—, I mean, I got a seat in the smoking section. 
But I don't smoke anymore, and, well, …"

My grip on the ice scoop released from the death-grip I hadn't realized I'd had. 
This was an easy request, and my heart went out to the kid. 
My grandfather had quit, and un-quit, more times than I could count when I was growing up.

"We've got a full flight tonight. 
But you know what you can do?"
I pointed at the indistinct shapes standing behind the translucent curtain between us and the smoking section. 
"Those passengers standing by the curtain are probably smokers with seats back here. 
You could ask one of them to switch with you."

He turned to look and seemed to perk up at the sight of a crowd jockeying for positions just beyond the divider.
"Yeah, I can do that. 
Thanks, uh, Lily."

"Of course. 
Let me know if you can't find someone. 
I can ask around for you, too."

He seemed mollified by this and went back to his seat. 
I'd remembered correctly: 13A, over the port wing, exit row seating. 
He was a tall kid—_when did I downgrade him from "young man" to "kid"?_—so it made sense that his parents had gotten him exit row seating.

I heard a lavatory door open and close, followed by a tap on my shoulder. 
I expected the elderly gentleman from 21C and turned to find I'd been correct. 
He seemed more at ease than when he'd gone in, so the worry that I'd have to clean up a mess evaporated almost as fast as it had solidified.

"Yes, sir?"

"Do you have a paper?"

Something about how he chewed on that trailing _R_ made me think he'd been from some Eastern European country before coming Stateside, probably around the same time as my grandparents.
His eyes never left my face and I couldn't help but compare that comfortable gaze with the nervous and shifting gaze of 13A. 
I turned to look in the rack on the door of the coat closet next to the galley. 
It had a handful of magazines but no paper. 
As I turned back to the man I caught a blur of motion by the cart. 
A surreptitious glance down at my stocks showed me down by two small bottles.

I could confront him. 
We were giving away the drinks tonight—why did he need to steal them?  Or … I raised an eyebrow at him and lifted one cheek into a knowing smirk. 
I left it long enough to make it obvious to him that I knew exactly what had happened. 
He wasn't embarrassed, but nor was he cocky.

"Nervous flyer, mister … ?"

"Duchesne."
He held out a hand which I would have sworn should have held the two bottles but was empty. 
"But Jim is fine."

_Jim Duchesne, 21C. 
Got it._

He continued as he shook my hand with a light, respectful but not-too-formal touch.
"Let's just say I know how old this plane is and what that means."

I didn't have a response for that. 
I think my face may have slipped from amused smirk to impressed incredulity.

"Well I've only been flying for 6 months, but I can say I haven't had any problems like that so far."

His shrug of a reply was noncommittal.

"It looks like we don't have a paper back here, but I'll check when I go forward. 
I'll bring one back if we have one."
HDA didn't stock them, but it was a common enough request that we kept a lookout for leftovers and intercepted them when people tried to throw them away.

He inclined his head in thanks and turned to make his way back to his seat.

A few minutes and a few more questions later and the cart was stocked. 
By the time Terry made it back to me my brain had finished the shift from homework to flight work and I was ready to get service done so we could put people to sleep.

"What did 18E want?"

"Extra blankets. 
The poor dear, she looks terrified. 
I don't think she's ever flown before."
His gaze lingered over the cart, taking stock as he spoke. 
He frowned at something before picking up two cans of cola and handing them to me. 
"Swap these out for sugar-free. 
This stuff will keep people up all night."

I shrugged and nodded in acknowledgment. 
"Good point."

I reached for the can storage, but a _ding!_ stopped me. 
A blue light showed on the wall panel. 
As I switched out the cans, Terry scanned the overheads for the call light.

"18E again. 
She's going to be some work."

"We should see what she wants before we start service. 
I can do it."

I unwedged myself from behind the cart and put on my best face as I walked to row 18. 
The lady sitting in E, the middle seat, looked ancient.
Her skin was pale and papery, a sheen of sweat on her forehead. 
The window seat next to her was empty—likely a smoker getting in their last cigarette for the evening. 
The forty-something man on the aisle in D was reading a magazine and completely disinterested.

But me?
As soon as I saw the woman my alarm bells started screaming. 
I couldn't put my finger on it—it wasn't danger or fear. 
Or it was fear, but not for myself. 
Something made me fear for this woman. 
She didn't look sick, but by no accounts did she look well.

I reached under the overhead and deactivated the call light. 
Something told me to squat down in the aisle to get eye level with the woman. 
I'm a tall girl, and towering over her sent the wrong impression. 
We're not supposed to squat, and my skirt made it tricky, but I couldn't help myself.

"How may I help you, ma'am?"

Her voice quivered, soft and broken.
"My medication."
Each phrase was punctuated with a breath and a motion of several layers of blankets wrapped atop her. 
"For my heart. 
In my bag."
A weak finger pointed up from a hand that didn't let go of the wrap.

I nodded and was out of the squat and reaching for the overhead before my brain caught up with me. 
Fetching carry-ons from the overhead shelf for passengers was discouraged, and a bad idea as a general rule. 
I saw that the man in 18D had put his magazine in his lap and leaned over to the woman.

"Are you sure you're okay?"
His voice was a whisper which I doubt was heard outside of the three of us.

The overhead held a briefcase and two purses. 
Damn. 
This is why we don't touch passenger items—I couldn't be sure which was hers and I didn't want the lady from 18F to walk back up to us and see me holding her bag.

Wait, I could tell. 
One purse was leather, bulky and professional. 
The other was cotton, well-worn, and the same shade of lavender as the collar sticking out from under 18E's blanket.

"The lavender bag, ma'am?"

18E gave the tiniest of nods as she sucked another breath through her teeth.

The bag was wedged between the leather purse and briefcase, and took some shimmying to get loose. 
I reached up to put a second hand around it when I felt a buzz and the ring finger on my right hand went numb. 
My hand jerked back and I stared at it. 
Nothing was wrong with it and it was already regaining feeling. 
I shook it, flexing and curling it in front of my eyes.

The man in 18D looked up at me, snapping me back into what I had been doing. 
I pulled the bag down and began to hand it to the woman.

"I can help her," said 18D as he intercepted the bag.
I looked to the woman for confirmation, and only released my hold on the bag after she nodded at me and gave a shaky smile. 
I looked back at the man, staring into his eyes, searching for something that would make me feel okay about leaving him to care for the woman.

He seemed to realize what I wanted and his eyes widened for a brief moment before he smiled at me and looked to my name tag.
"Thanks, Lily. 
I didn't realize she'd forgotten, but I can help her from here. 
Could she get some water?"

I nodded and walked back, still too thrown off balance to say anything. 
I curled and uncurled my hand, even though it already felt normal again. 
Terry gave me an inquisitive look as I approached.

"Everything on the up and up?"

I bit my lip, considering my response while pouring water from the pitcher into a small plastic cup.

"We should keep an eye on her. 
She doesn't look well." 
I held up a finger to signal that I'd be right back, then walked to 18.

The man in 18D had the purse open on his lap. 
It had the usual detritus I'd gotten used to seeing in my grandmother's purse: makeup cases, tissues, something in a royal purple leather that was probably the corner of a wallet. 
18D was struggling to open a dark orange prescription bottle. 
I reached past him to put down the tray from the seat in front of her, placing the water into its divot.

The pills in the bottle were huge, dry and chalky-looking things. 
I didn't envy her having to swallow them. 
The man had gotten the top off and was reviewing the label.

"Two?" he asked her, receiving a nod.

His eyes came back to mine and he gave me a nod before returning his focus to the woman.

I looked to Terry and gave him a similar nod. 
He acknowledged and unlocked the cart wheels, pushing it toward me. 
He didn't speak until we'd gotten to 7, the first row in the smoking section.

"Good to go?" he asked me.

I wasn't sure what I thought about the encounter, so I gave him a squint and head tilt meant to communicate _let's talk later_. 
He acknowledged it with a mirrored head tilt before putting on his face and turning to 9A to take a drink order from the man sitting there. 
I took a moment to do the same, though I admit it took longer than I would have liked.

The man in 7A was already looking at me, cigarette between his fingers dangling lazy and half-forgotten next to his face.

"Good evening, sir. 
What can—"

"Vodka tonic, sweetie."
