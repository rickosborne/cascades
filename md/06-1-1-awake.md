# Awake

"Alex."

Oh, hey, that's me.

"Alex."

Why was someone hissing my name? 
And saying it with a weird accent.

"Talk to me." 
That accent. 
Terry?

I struggled to open my eyes. 
A brown haze of a perm surrounded an indistinct face that was tanned to only a few shades lighter. 
Terry.

The synchronized drumbeats in my head and chest began to slow and my senses came back one at a time.

Sound: Where was the wind? 
It's so quiet now.

Smell: Cheap rum.
It smelled like brown sugar, sticky fingers, and poor choices.

Sight: Terry's face couldn't have been more than a few inches from mine, eyes darting left and right between my own.

Touch: He had a grip on my arms that would likely leave bruises. 
I think I remember him shaking me.

Taste: … something. 
There was a memory of the stale, metallic oxygen from the bottle, but it was fading fast.

"Terry!" 
My hands gripped his arms in return. 
"The plane!"

But as more around me came into focus, I realized where I was: sitting in the jump seat by the Coach lavatories. 
I was no more than three feet from where a gaping, cloud-filled hole had been only moments before.

"There we go!" 
He rocked back and stood up before me, pulling out of my grip. 
"You alright? 
You gave me quite a scare."

Nothing made sense! 
Where's the hole? 
Why weren't we falling out of the sky, centripetal force pushing us against the walls?

_Dios mio, that's what that had been: we were in enough of a flat spin to push us against the walls._

I started to dry heave but nothing came up. 
Terry was a blur of motion and there was an airsick bag in front of my mouth.

_But … not … now. 
This is normal. 
Gravity works again._

"Take it easy. 
Just breathe for me."

"Terry—" 
My throat was dry, my voice a crackling whisper. 
I licked my lips, closed my eyes, and started over. 
"Terry, what about the crash?"

His eyes shot wide at the last word and his head spun around, searching to see if another passenger had heard me. 
He tilted his head and shot me a look that made two things perfectly clear:

One, I may have been a rookie, but I should still know which words to avoid in flight.

Two, he had no idea what I was talking about.

"But … I …" 
I licked my lips and settled on "what happened?"

He squatted in front of me again, lowering the airsick back and folding it flat with a flick that all of us could do without thinking.

"You fainted."

"I did?"

"You were fine one second and half-way to the floor the next." 
His voice, already in that _sotto voce_ we used out of habit when talking with other crew, dropped to barely audible above the white noise of the jet engines.
"When did you last eat?"

A question fair enough that I answered it without thinking.

"Sandwich. 
When I got the call."

Flight attendants were not exactly known for our stellar eating habits. 
We weren't home often enough or long enough to keep well-stocked pantries, and we didn't make enough money to dine out everywhere we went. 
Many of us subsisted on in-flight food, and I knew some who flew literally to feed themselves. 
It didn't help that we were expected to stay "appealing", the less offensive version of "thin". 
Oh sure, the airlines weren't allowed to fire us for putting on visible weight, but we all knew exactly what would happen.

Terry looked at me, dubious.

"Sit here." 
The stone in his gaze was shattered by my amusement that the last word came out "hee-ya". 
"Don't move."

He walked off at _Don't Interrupt Me I'm On Business_ speed up the aisle.

I took a moment to look around.

Everything was back. 
Everything.

There was no hole, no screaming passengers, no cloudy sky. 
It was normal.

The cabin lights were up, rigged for evening illumination instead of night.

The beverage cart stood, wheels locked in place between me and the galley. 
It was fully stocked, loaded with plastic cups, aluminum cans, and small glass bottles of cheap alcohol.

And that rum smell? 
There was a broken bottle between me and the cart. 
The neck had sheared off and half of the liquid had spilled onto the carpet.

Seeing the mess, something clicked inside. 
I stood up, walked to the galley for a towel, and stooped to mop up the mess. 
It took a moment to realize that my head was clear—the drumbeat was gone.
I wasn't at all dizzy or nauseous. 
Other than being a bit confused, I was perfectly fine.

I was also using my right arm and hand, without any pain.
The sound of its wrenching snap when I'd hit the bulkhead still reverberated in my ears.
And I could still feel the lightning bolts of pain I got from trying to grab the oxygen bottle.
But now ... there was no pain at all.

Terry returned, small plastic container in his hand. 
I recognized it as a single-serving salad from one of the First Class meal packs. 
He waved me around behind the cart and into the galley, flourishing a metal fork from nowhere.

"Take a moment. 
We've got time."

He put himself between me and anyone in the last few rows who might turn around, keeping me in his peripheral vision.

I was going to protest, but it occurred to me that he was right—I was hungrier than I had realized. 
I had the lid off and half of the salad put away before I realized what I was doing.

Had I just fainted and hit my head?

_No. 
Not possible. 
It's been hours since we were here in the galley together, stocking the cart._

"What, uh," I whispered. 
Terry smiled at a passenger I couldn't see and inclined his head toward me to show he was listening. 
"What time do you have?"

"Coming up on nine-thirty, Pacific." 
Terry's watch was a huge gold-plated monstrosity that I could almost read from six feet away. 
It had a just-off-vertical bar of hands on the 12 and 6—he kept his watch on Eastern time and translated without thinking about it.

I wolfed down the other two bites of my salad.

"We need to go," I threw the cart a vague wave with my fork, "if we're going to beat the weather." 
I cut off his squint with "And I'm feeling better already. 
Thank you very much."

He nodded and unlocked the wheels of the cart, pulling it forward as he backed up the aisle, throwing cautious glances over his shoulder. 
I gave my mouth a quick dab with a paper napkin and caught up to him a few rows later, pushing the cart to allow him to face forward.

We reached the front of Coach, him at row 7 and me next to 9. 
I had the strangest feeling of _déjà vu_ that I couldn't nail down. 
It felt like I had done this all before, and I remembered doing it before, but …

But I've done this same thing hundreds of times in the last six months.

And of course I recognize these people—I helped them board, got them pillows, looked them each in the eyes as I performed the safety demonstration.

_You're just … I don't know. 
Maybe you're juggling too much._

I'd lost a few seconds in thought and the man in 9A harrumphed at me. 
I gave him my warmest, non-culpable smile.

"What can I get for you this evening, sir?"

"What booze ya got?"
