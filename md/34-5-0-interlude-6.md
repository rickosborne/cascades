# Florida, March 27, 1967

Jen straightened the stack of papers, slotting them into an unlabeled manila folder, then into her briefcase before locking it closed.
She wasn't supposed to take work home, but several dozen pages of handwritten notes weren't going to collate and transcribe themselves overnight.

Wiping a tear from her eye, she leaned back in her chair and exhaled for what felt like the first time in the last hour.
She could feel her throat close up as the words she'd just typed ran circles in her mind.
Trying to distract herself, she ejected the ink ribbon from her typewriter.
She grabbed a heavy glass ashtray, a box of matches, and a cigarette, and walked outside.

The night air was still a little chilly and damp from the afternoon rain.
The skies had stayed overcast even after the sun had gone down, leaving the humidity to just hang there in the way that it could only on the Florida coast.

She'd burned enough typewriter ribbons to have this one blazing in seconds.
It crackled and sputtered, while the crash of the surf, the gentle pressure of the sea breeze blew, and the salty marine smell of the ocean helped her mind detach.
The now-glowing cigarette between her fingers should have helped, too, but wasn't as effective as she'd have liked.

"That bad, huh?"

She hadn't heard the glass door slide open behind her.
Nor had she noticed the older woman step up beside her against the railing.
Jen leaned to touch shoulders, reveling in the woman's reassuring sturdiness.

Her reply didn't address the question, but seemed to be a continuation of whatever was on her mind.

"Five minutes.
How can five minutes be so inconsequential, but also forever?"

She shook her head, gathering herself.

"I think we need to tell them."
Jen's normally husky voice was so ephemeral it could have been lost in the murmur of sea-grass lining the beach.
"We can't ... we can't stand by.
Not while ..."

She trailed into silence, bringing her palms to her eyes.
When she removed them, a handkerchief held steady in her peripheral.
She took it and blew her nose, turning to thank the other woman.

"That's," Mary paused and seemed to reconsider her words.
"That's a very big risk."

Jen knew they were both thinking the same things.
Both wanted to help, feeling crushed under the weight of all the responsibility they felt they had.
But also, both were all too familiar with the limits of what they could do.

They'd had this conversation before.
The start of it anyway.
But they'd never managed to finish it.

"I know," Jen said.
"But it's time.
We can help."

The older woman rustled about in her hair for a moment, before handing Jen the thick silver chain and pendant.

"Take mine.
We know it doesn't do me any good."
The older woman wrapped the younger woman's hand around the necklace to stall off any protest.

"And we both know you're going to need yours.
Just in case."
