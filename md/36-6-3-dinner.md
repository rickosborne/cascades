# Dinner

I jabbed a trio of fries into the paper ramekin of ketchup.

"So who are you?"

"I work with Dr. Hamilton."

"At NASA?"

Jennifer shrugged, equivocating.

"Ish.
Let's say we're government contractors and leave it at that."
She took a massive bite from the burger in her hands.

"And Dearborn?"

"Also worked with us."

"Irene?"

"Not sure, though I have my suspicions."

I shoveled more fries into my mouth, alternating with sips of my drink.
I was hungrier than I'd realized.
I lowered my voice, even though no one was anywhere near us.

"Was that some kind of experiment?"

"An accident, I think.
You tell me.
Did it start when I think it did—right before you came and got Mary?"

"Nine fourteen, every time.
I don't know what started it."

"Think about what you were doing the first time through."

"I had just helped Dearborn get Mary her pills."
My stomach rolled at the thought that I had helped him.

"From her bag?
Did you get an electric shock?
Made your hand go numb?"

Fries, half way to my mouth but forgotten, hung in the air between us.

"Yeah, exactly that.
What was that?"

Jennifer worked several more bites off her burger before continuing.

"SRI.
Synaptic Resonance Initiator."

"Excuse me?"

"How's your head?"

The non-sequitur caught me off guard and snapped me back.
The fries in my hand finished the journey to my mouth.

"Better, but not great."

"That headache will take another ten to twelve hours to wear off.
Then it's over."

"What will be over?
What happened to me?"

"It's still happening."

My fist hit the table before I realized it was moving.

"Are you kidding me?"

"Calm down," she said in a low tone.

"Are you telling me I am going to loop again?"

"I'm saying," she growled, "that you will if you don't stay calm."

That one rocked me back in my seat.
That was the answer: each time I'd looped it had been because of—

"My heart rate."

"Bingo," she pointed a finger at me.
"Adrenaline triggers it."

"Triggers what?"

"Adreno-synaptic temporal cascade."

"Cascade?"

She finished off her first burger, picking up her second.

"What do you know about Apollo 1?"

The tangent didn't throw me as much this time.

"That was the one with the fire, right?
I was in high school."

"Do you know how long they were in the command module before the fire started?"

"No clue."

"Five and a half hours.
Then when the call of fire was made, it took rescue crews another five minutes to get the hatch open.
_And they were on the pad._"

"Okay …"

"Apollo 13 was three years later and one hundred seventy thousand miles away.
Another three years and Skylab went up, damaged on launch.
The space program is hard.
We're pushing as fast as we can, but we don't always get it right."

I was silent, not daring to interrupt.

"My team, Mary's team, was supposed to help NASA get it right, even when they don't."

"What does that mean?"

"Two months from now, NASA starts test flights for the Space Shuttle program."

"What's that?"

"It's the next step into space.
Think reusable airplanes to get us up there instead of rockets."

"You're kidding.
That sounds awesome."

"Literally.
It will be amazing.
But it can't fail.
The consequences would be unbelievable.
The Russians are already so far ahead.
Any more accidents would cripple NASA, sending America back to the stone age."

I finished my own first burger, deciding if I wanted the second.
Jennifer looked me in the eyes.

"Imagine you discovered a substance.
This substance, when electrically charged, induced a field.
That field, when it came in contact with a human nervous system, had an effect."

"The shock from Dr. Hamilton's purse."

She raised her eyebrows as an answer.

"Your brain is a biological computer, right?
A mass of neurons swimming in a bath of fluid, electricity zapping from one side to the other.
What if this imaginary field induced a resonance in that electricity?
Like a standing wave in a pool."

She moved her half-eaten burger up and down.

"Springs, harmonic motion, sure," I said.
"I took Physics a few semesters ago."

"Such a resonance would eventually fade away naturally.
But add in a destabilizing element—"

"Adrenaline?"

She nodded, picking up where she left off.

"—and something interesting happens.
Our imaginary resonance pattern ends up in a destructive feedback loop."

I put down my burger and rubbed my hands absently.
Jennifer smiled at this.

"Right.
It would manifest as losing sensation in your extremities, then your senses, _et cetera_.
Until, we might imagine, a kind of critical energy is built up.
The resonance is self-correcting.
It fixes itself through a neural cascade, reverting the resonance to a time when it was most stable: right after it first initiated."

"It sends my brain back in time?"

She took a long drag of her drink, reminding me of how she smoked.

"Say instead that the initiation and the critical energy of an agitation are linked.
When the cascade unwinds the agitation back to the initiation, much of your brain's bioelectricity comes along for the ride.
Memories and emotions, mostly."

Slack-jawed, I couldn't do much more than stare.
She pointed her drink's straw at me.

"That is … if such a thing were possible.
It sounds like science fiction to me."
Her mouth curled up into a wry smile which she obliterated by taking another drag of her drink.

"So as long as I can stay calm for the next twelve hours, I should be okay."

She nodded, polishing off her second burger.

"What's with the headaches?" I asked.

"How many times?" she countered.

"Six repeats, seven times through."

"Be glad you didn't make it to ten.
That bioelectricity that hitches a ride?
It accumulates, like a residue.
At eight or nine you start to lose the ability to tell the difference between what's happening now and what you half-remember happening from before.
At ten or eleven, you don't want to know."

She shivered in her seat.

"When they asked you how you knew about the bomb, what did you tell them?"
