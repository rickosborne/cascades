# After Service

Service was a 40-minute blur. 
I checked out somewhere around the third passenger. 
When you’re used to being behind a bar keeping a half-dozen orders of far more complex drinks, taking and then serving three at a time requires less brainpower than it does patience.

We stowed the cart and did one last pass through the cabin before Terry got on the PA.

“Lily’s coming through the cabin now to collect any leftover service items. 
We’re going to dim the lights so everyone can get some sleep. 
We’re going to go through some weather in the next hour, so please be sure to buckle up before you nod off. 
Good night, and see you tomorrow morning over Florida.”

As I passed 18, I saw the elderly woman was asleep and the man had gone back to his magazine. 
I also saw that in 18F now sat a woman around the same age as the man, late 30s or early 40s. 
She had pale, freckled skin and bright red hair pulled back in a severe ponytail, both of which shone under the glare of her reading light. 
She turned off her light and smiled as I passed, but something about her brought out a return smile from me that was more plastic than sincere.

“How’s Mrs. Hamilton?” Terry asked as I stepped into the tiny galley alcove with him. 
“18E,” he clarified.

“Sleeping. 
Do you know if the man and woman are with her?”

“The manifest lists different names, so I don’t think they are related. 
I believe his name is Dearborn, Ernest or Edward or something. 
The bluey is Jennifer Keats.”

“Bluey?”

His smile was wide behind his thick mustache. 
“The red-haired woman.”

“Bluey, huh?  Okay then.”

“Right, well, Dearborn, Hamilton, Keats.”  His hand made little partitioning motions as he said each name, recreating the seating order from the aisle. 
“It seemed like Mr. Dearborn and Mrs. Hamilton were friendly. 
I didn’t get to see Ms. Keats with them. 
She was already in smoking by the time I got there and didn’t sit down until after service.”

“I saw Dearborn give Mrs. Hamilton some horse pills. 
She was asleep the next time I saw her during service.”  I ran my tongue along the back of my teeth, lost in thought. 
I blinked a few times and snapped out of it. 
“Hey, I can get this cleaned up, if you want.”

Terry smiled but shook his head. 
“I appreciate the offer,” it came out “oh-fuh” and a part of me took a moment to appreciate that I got to work every day with people from all around the world. 
“But I don’t mind.”  He pointed at the jump seats behind me. 
“Enjoy your book. 
I’ve got this.”

In truth, I wasn’t in the mood to go back to studying, but it wasn’t worth discussing. 
These overnighters could go either way. 
Most any other flight would find her doing most of the work, as she almost always had less seniority than any of the other crew. 
Overnighters were, however, boring beyond belief. 
For the next six hours or so, only a handful of passengers would be awake at any time, and their demands on the cabin crew would be minimal. 
If Terry wanted something to do to pass the time, that was his right.

In minutes I was buried back into Chapter 13, of something like 40. 
We weren’t going to get through the entire book this semester, as the next course would cover the second half. 
At least that’s what the clerk in the bookstore had said to calm me down when I’d gotten emotional and loud about textbook prices. 
I was a little behind—the final exam was in two weeks and I was supposed to have everything up to Chapter 20 under my belt. 
The holidays had been good for my wallet with extra lines that no one else had wanted, but that extra flight time had meant less study time.

Chapter 13 of “Algorithms and Architecture” was about caching, the idea that you could make the trade-off to use some fast but expensive memory to hold data that might be requested from slower but cheaper hard disk drives. 
Caching seemed to me like something of a dark art: there was no way to guess exactly which data might be requested more often than others, making the most sense to cache, and which would just waste precious cache space.

My thought experiment with the drinks during service was a good example: we’d ended up using far more vodka than rum, so Terry had made a trip to restock. 
I’d predicted poorly, so we’d lost a few minutes here and there to evicting stale cache items (rum) and replacing them with hot items (vodka).

The analogy wasn’t perfect. 
In a cache, accessing an item doesn’t consume it like it did for our drink cart. 
But it’s close enough.

I liked that this chapter was easy enough to apply to my work. 
Some of the other chapters were much less so. 
I’ve yet to figure out how recursion could apply to anything in my job.

I’d been rubbing at my temples for a while before I realized it. 
The skin there was warm from the activity. 
I’d reread the same paragraph two or three times, or probably more like five if I’m honest about it. 
I had a headache.

That gave me pause.

I have a headache.

I don’t get headaches. 
My grandfather gets them. 
Got them. 
But not me. 
Oh, sure, I’ve gotten the stray headache here and there, but I could count the number in the last five years on one hand.

This one was a low-level pressure. 
Almost a throbbing that sort of ran around a racetrack along the inside of my skull. 
It didn’t hurt inasmuch as it was just uncomfortable. 
And it felt like it kept rolling around up there, unlike the stationary heartbeat throb of headaches I’d had before.

_It’s the book, genius. 
How many times has grandma told you not to read those tiny letters in this low light?_

I could hear her voice, chiding me: “Lily, put down that book. 
I can’t get you to eat enough carrots to fix what you’re doing to your eyes.”

I put my bookmark back in place and looked up to find Terry gone from the galley. 
A glance to the clocks there, one set to Pacific, told me that I’d lost maybe 45 minutes to reading. 
The galley was immaculate, so I checked the lavatories. 
All were in reasonable order, with only a few drops of water on the counter here and there to keep them from being considered spotless. 
I hadn’t paid much attention while I was reading, but I don’t think more than three or four people had used them in that time.

Terry wasn’t visible in the aisle, so I figured he must have been in First Class visiting Pamela, the third member of our crew. 
As we were setting up the cabin in preflight, I’d thought I’d sensed some history between the two. 
It could have just been the usual chemistry of a pair of people used to working with each other every day, but it could have been more. 
If Terry had been back here I would have asked him about it.

Actually … no, I probably wouldn’t. 
I didn’t know either of them well enough for that kind of question.
