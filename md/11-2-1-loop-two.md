I gasped and fell to my knees as the pressure in my head vanished.

The sound of breaking glass and the sugary smell of cheap rum were followed by Terry's exclamation of "Lily!"

The pressure may have gone, but I still couldn't quite focus.
I shook my head to clear out the cobwebs.
It only helped a little.

"I'm fine," I gasped.
"Sorry.
Just … just give me a sec."

I stood, shaky, and leaned back against the storage door, once again whole and right where it was supposed to be.

"It was different that time."

Terry was at my side, hand around my arm.
"What's that?"

"Nothing, sorry.
Talking to myself."
I turned to face him, rubbing at my temples.
"Really, I'm fine.
Just low blood sugar, I think."

He released his grip on my arm but continued to stare at me, focusing on one eye and then the other.

"When was the last time you ate?"

My eyes went to the departure clock in the galley: a few minutes after 9:15pm, Pacific time.

_It was either 4 hours ago, 11 hours ago, or 2 hours ago.
It depends on your point of view._

I didn't have a quick response, which he mistook to mean that I was ashamed of the answer.

"Stay here.
I'll be right back."

I considered stopping him, but realized that I was hungry again.
I could use the salad he'd bring back.
These resets, or loops, or whatever they were, made me hungry each time they restarted.

Why had the time of the explosion changed?

Although "explosion" was the term going around and around in my thoughts, I supposed that it could have been an explosive decompression.
It could have been a bomb, but it could also have been that some piece of the airframe had succumbed to fatigue and failed.
Several commercial jet crashes had happened because a door lock snapped, or a cargo door hadn't been sealed.

And let's be honest: the HDA fleet wasn't shiny and new.

In the first iteration of the loop the explosion had happened around 6:45 Eastern.
In the second it was around 4:15—two and a half hours earlier.
What changed?

Wait, if it changed … that means it probably wasn't mechanical failure or weather related.
It was intentional.

_It was an explosion!
Of course it was intentional!_

I saw _Airport_ with my grandparents when it came out a few years ago.
My grandmother had been so excited to see a movie about air travel.
I had asked her how realistic it was and she had waggled her hand at me.

"It is and it isn't."

I'd pressed her about the main plot: a guy with a bomb blows himself up because he thinks his wife will collect his life insurance payout.

"That part," she had waggled her hand again.
"It might be possible at a regional airport where they don't have the budget to install the metal detectors or to hire bomb-sniffing dogs.
But on an international flight with that many passengers?
It would be very difficult.
And we are all good at spotting nervous passengers.
Most of the time if they are nervous it is because it is their first time flying.
But we can always tell if they are up to no good."

I had been dubious at the time, and I don't know if my experience as a flight attendant had changed that opinion.
Yes, we saw so many travelers that we did begin to get a sense for troublemakers or people who needed an extra comforting smile.
I'd also handled my fair share of drunk and rowdy passengers—I'd learned how to handle them in my time as a waitress and bartender.
But I had never been faced with someone like that bomber: someone who wanted to harm himself or others.

Had I seen anyone acting suspicious enough that I thought they could be capable of trying to blow up the airplane?

_Both times, the explosion was back here._

I spun and opened the coat closet.
We'd departed from Seattle in December, so the closet was packed.
There had to have been almost twenty coats of varying sizes, styles, and weights, including the one I had expected to see: avocado green cashmere.
The closet was packed so full that I couldn't see more than the fabric of each arm.

I dropped into a squat and ran my hands along the floor of the closet.
I knew it was only arms-length deep, but I couldn't touch the back wall from my position.
As near as I could tell there was nothing on the floor, not even dust bunnies.

"Looking for something?"
Terry's voice came from the other side of the opened door.

I waved a hand out to the side of the door and stood up, giving myself a moment to come up with an excuse.

"I thought I saw someone throw a carry-on in here when they hung up their coat.
I didn't want it sliding around when we hit the weather later.
But it's not here, so I guess I imagined it."

"Oh," he said, noncommittal.
He handed me the salad.
"Pamela says you owe her one."

I took the container, but shot him an eyebrow.
"Pamela said that?"

For a moment I thought he was going to continue the gag, but he gave up.

"Right, that was me.
You owe me one."

I grabbed a fork from the galley and almost inhaled the salad.
"That sounds more like it," I got out between bites.

"Slow down, we've got time."

It was too late—the salad was already gone.
I stowed the container.
The departure clock on the galley bulkhead showed 9:27pm Pacific.
I looked up to see Terry sniffing and looking around.

"Do you smell that?"

Rum.
The bottle I'd broken when the loop restarted.
Last time it had made a mess next to the cart.
This time we could smell it but not see it, meaning it was probably under the cart.
I unlocked the wheels and pulled the cart out of the aisle and into the galley.
Sure enough, a broken bottle of rum had made a small dark patch on the carpet.

Terry knelt and picked up the bottle and its severed neck, holding them up to get a better look.

"It looks like a clean break.
I don't see any fragments in the carpet.
Toss me a rag?"

He sopped up what he could, leaving a patch that was damp but not unsafe for the passengers on their way to the lavatories.

"That reminds me," I said, and started pulling rum bottles off the cart.

_How many did we have left over?_

I remembered putting back two bottles of gin, so I grabbed those, too.
I pushed them onto the liquor shelf and started piling rum bottles into my hands until it felt like what I remembered from the last loop.

"We're going to need those," Terry said.

"I stocked the cart earlier without thinking.
Like you said, rum will just keep people awake."

Terry nodded in agreement.
"Bloody Marys."
He leaned across the cart, conspiratorial.
"I think the tomato mix is on it's way out, anyway."

"I was thinking the same thing," I said, holding up the replacement bottles of vodka and dropping them into place on the cart.
