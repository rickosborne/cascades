# Before Weather

I kept my purse in a small storage compartment in the First Class galley.
On most flights I didn't have any use for it, and First Class was more secure than a similar compartment in Coach as there was far less traffic.
Some ladies can't get fifteen feet from their bags without a nervous breakdown, but I'm not one of them.

Frankly, I'm too broke to have anything precious in it.

While waiting for the tea to steep I grabbed my school notebook and a pen from my bag.
Also useless on most flights during daylight hours as I wouldn't have the time to study my notes, they were my constant companions on overnight flights.

I put them down on my jump seat, telling Pamela as I passed that I would be right back.

The door to the cockpit was a few steps past the forward lavatory.
The door had a knob with a lock, but it was kept unlocked on most flights.
I knocked and let myself in.
Both men turned to look at me.

"Captain.
Captain."
I nodded to each of them.

Simon, sitting on the starboard side, spoke while Lawrence returned to scanning his instruments.

"Is everything okay, Lily?"

The head attendant, more often than not the one running First Class, was considered the interface to the cockpit.
It was understandable that their first question would be if everything was all right.

"Yes, though I was hoping we could borrow the passenger manifest for a few minutes.
We have a passenger with a heart condition who is having a bad night.
I thought it might be good to know who the doctors are before we get into the weather, just in case."

"Good thinking.
Of course."
Simon picked up a folder sitting between the two of them, flipped through several loose sheets of paper in a pocket, and handed it to me.

"Thanks.
I've got a pot of English Breakfast going.
Can I bring either of you a mug?"

Simon pointed to a tall white mug in a holder next to him.

"Pamela has us on a coffee IV drip, but thank you."

"I'll be right back with this," I said, and let myself out.

Pamela watched me as I passed her a second time.
I poured us both mugs of tea, returning to the jump seats.

"Is that the manifest?"

"Yeah.
Did Terry talk to you about Mrs. Hamilton?"

"I don't believe so."
She slipped a beverage napkin into her book where her finger had been holding her place.
"What's wrong?"

I told her about my original encounter with row 18, trying to use some of the words she had used to describe Mrs. Hamilton in the previous loop.
Her sharp inhalation at "weak heart" let me know that I'd managed to work my way past her mask.

I skimmed a finger down the manifest, holding it between us.

"It looks like we have three doctors on board.
Dr. Henry Forrest in 3B and what could be a husband and wife in 24E and 24F, Drs. Alan and Edna Michelson."

Pamela's tone was dry.
"Dr. Forrest had three martinis and is now fast asleep.
Do you remember the Michelsons?"

I closed my eyes and mentally walked back through beverage service, counting three rows forward from the galley.

"I … think so.
If they are who I think they are, he had a gin and tonic and she declined a drink."
I opened my eyes.
"I don't think we'll need them, but it's good to know where they are."
Tea mug still in hand but half-forgotten and cooling, I stood up with the list in my other hand.
"I'll get this back to the pilots."
I put the mug on my seat and walked slowly back to the cockpit.

I perused the list, picking out two specific names: Ernest Dearborn and Mary Hamilton.
Ernest, Mary, Jennifer.

That clinched it.
I wasn't crazy, but I knew specifics I had no reason to know.

The confirmation was nice, but it led to more anxiety.
What in the world do you do when you're stuck repeating the same flight over and over?

I was not going down the Twilight Zone William Shatner route.
Of course, the implication in that episode had been that the things he'd seen had been real.
It was the experience that had driven him mad.
So maybe that wasn't the best comparison.

Either way, HDA training had not prepared me for this.

After returning the paper to Simon, I tried my best to be nonchalant about taking my seat and picking up my notebook.
I wrote down all of the names and seat assignments I could remember.
I knew the notes wouldn't transfer into the next loop—nothing else had so far—but I hoped the act of writing them down would help me remember them.

The first tentative rumbles of weather started a few minutes later, followed by the _ding!_ and the Fasten Seat Belts sign.
I looked into the galley at the two clocks: the left clock read 10:44 while it was 1:44 according to the one on the right.
I inscribed this time into my notebook, then flipped it closed before standing.

"I can do it," I said as Pamela started to get up.
"I wanted to stretch my legs anyway."

She looked at me with an opaque expression, shrugged, and said "thanks" before returning to her book.

I put my notebook back into my purse in its compartment and started the rounds to check that passengers were secured.
