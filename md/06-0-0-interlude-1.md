# Siberia, June 30, 1908

## The morning of the Tunguska Event

The young woman staggered into the clearing around the small hut.
Without trees for support, her steps became more erratic until she finally fell to her knees, clutching her head.

The man scaling and gutting fish didn't notice her and continued his work.

"Papa," the woman croaked.
It wasn't loud enoughâ€”he didn't hear her.
She tried to stand but her knees buckled.
Groaning with the effort, she pulled her hands away from her temples to raise herself to a crawl.
There was a cost.
She froze in place, panting and willing her elbows to be more reliable than her knees.

"Papa," the groan was louder this time.
Staring at his back, she saw him look up from his fish without stopping.
The pounding in her head told her she was screaming his name, but it was still lost on the gentle breeze.

A final "Papa!" was enough to turn him toward her as the effort drove her again to the ground.
In her sixteen years, it was the most difficult thing she'd ever done.

The man dropped the fish and knife into the grass as he ran to her.

"Niura!" she heard him yell as she rolled onto her back.

One hand went to her forehead while the other raised above the grass to help her father find her.
"Here, papa," was all she could manage in a hoarse whisper.
"Here."

She felt him hit the ground next to her.

The next thing she was aware of was the smell of their _chum_: smoky reindeer hides and fish.
The sun was off her dark hair, though the light coming through her eyelids was from the day, not a fire.

Her head still pounded and her palms went to it without thought.

"Niura, be still."

Despite her pain, the voice made the woman smile.
"Papa."

"What happened to you?"
He dripped water from a skin into her mouth.
"_Chulugdy_?"

The word came from the man as a joke that wasn't funny.
He spoke of one-legged monsters instead of real things. 

"I'm not a child anymore."

She opened her eyes to see him brushing off her reply.
He crouched over her, sighing in resignation.
The fermented smell of his breath was strong and unmistakable.
She tensed and tried to clear her head.

"What of the _argish_?
Why are you alone?"

Flashes of memory, her reindeer herd alive and happy and then dead and mangled, made her wince with very real pain.
"They are gone, papa."

"Gone?"
She heard the edge in his voice, off balance and teetering between fear for his daughter, anger at her loss, and fear again for their future.

"They were taken."

"Taken?"
Her father was on his feet in an unsteady blur.
"By what?  Or who?"

She fumbled with the word that had been repeating in her head for the last two weeks.
She still had trouble believing it, though she had seen it with her own eyes.

"Seveki."
She was not as faithful in the old stories as he, and would not often speak in such terms with him, but the past few days left her with no other explanations.

Her father's mouth moved without sound.

"I swear, papa.
I saw it happen.
The entire herd."

"Tell me!" her father demanded, dropping back to her side.

She moved as if to sit up, but the throbbing in her head prevented it.

"I drove the _argish_ up the river, as we discussed.
We'd just come to the hills when Seveki came.
Not as you or I, but as an angry fist of fire."
She shuddered with the memory.

"The reindeer and I were watering, but we must have angered him.
Somehow.  I don't know.
He yelled and pushed me into the river.
I moved to swim to the shore, but the air burned with his arrival.
I had to stay under the water to avoid his wrath."

Her eyes locked onto his.
She searched for acknowledgement as he searched for lies.

"But I could not hide from his wrath for long.
When I came to the surface, he threw rocks at me."
She pointed at the cuts running along her hair and across her arms.
Some of them still had grit in them.

"It was then that I saw the reindeer.
They were dead.
All of them.
Seveki took their souls as punishment for hiding in the river from him."

He looked like he didn't believe her.

"Didn't you hear him, papa?
He was so loud."

The man fell onto his backside.

"_Khalganchuluk_ rattled the _chum_ this morning."
He looked abashed, lazily waving a hand at their home around them.
"I was not awake, so I yelled at him to go away.
But maybe it was Seveki, as you say."

"This morning?
No, papa, this was days ago.
Ten?  Maybe twelve?"

His consideration evaporated and he squinted at her.
"_Khalganchuluk_ was here this morning.
And you only left the day before yesterday.
What are you talking about?"

"Two days?"
She muttered as she pressed her wrists even tighter to her temples.
"That cannot be.
The visions ..."

"Do not call me a liar!"
The reprimand was harsh in the small space and a fresh wave of hot, fermented breath rolled across her.
"And what is this of visions?"

Niura's eyes watered as confusion gripped her.

"Seveki taunted me, papa.
I do not mean to call you a liar.
He confused me."

She thought this would placate him, but her words only made his jaw tighten.
She continued, but she felt her breathing quicken to match her father's.

"Each night he challenged me.
And when I failed," her words broke, "he threw me back to the river to show me the dead animals.
Every night.
At least ten."

"There were only two!"
The man's fists clenched and pressed into his thighs.

"I cannot explain it, father.
Seveki threw me down a hill, then back to the river.
When I avoided the hill he sent a bear to maul me, then I awoke from the dead with the herd dead around me.
I crept past the bear but slipped in some mud ... and back to the herd.
Each day was a new test, and each day I failed."

He pointed an unsteady hand at her cut flesh.
"These are not from a bear.
And you have no mud on you.
Lies!
Did you steal my herd?"

Her heart raced as the pitch of his voice rose to match his widening eyes.
Niura tried to cross her arms in front of her to ward off the blow she knew was coming.

And then the daylight flooded her eyes and she could smell the river.
She had failed Seveki again.
