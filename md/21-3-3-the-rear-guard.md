# The Rear Guard

I was bored one night in flight attendant school and figured out that it would take something under three minutes to fall from the cruising altitude of a 707.
Row 27 has fallen through the fuselage each time.
I don't want to think about how awful those three minutes must be for those people, buckled into an uncomfortable foam and aluminum seat that's plummeting to the ground.

I don't want to think about it, but a vision of the businesswoman, the man, and his son screaming and flailing threatens to take over my thoughts.

To distract myself, I try to work out a computer program to do the Newtonian physics calculation for such a descent, given inputs of altitude and drag.
It's morbid, but the intellectual exercise helps wall off the raw imagery of my imagination.

Between beverage service and lights-out I pulled the manifest ruse again and filled in a new half-dozen names.
This time I focused on the six people on the port size of rows 26 and 27, seats A through C.
I thought it would help me connect with the people in row 27.
I also considered that someone in 26 could have slid a bomb under their seat and kicked it backwards to 27.

The three ladies in 26 have different last names, but I've seen them chatting and comfortable with each other.
The manifest lists them as Lydia Horne in A, Abigail Tremont in B, and Katherine Montgomery in C.
Each of them seems to be somewhere in their late forties, or maybe early fifties.

Row 27 is easier: the businesswoman in 27A is Irene Peters, while both the father and son are listed as Harold Grant, presumably Junior in 27B and Senior in 27C.
Harold Jr. looks to be several years older than me, probably early thirties.
Harold Sr. looks very good for his age—I would have guessed mid-forties if his son hadn't been sitting next to him, but early fifties was more likely.

The departure clock in the First Class galley showed 10:20 as I headed back to Coach.
We would hit weather at 10:44 and turn off the lights a few minutes later.
More than half of the passengers were already asleep as I passed through.

The ladies of row 26 were fussing with pillows and blankets, all still awake.
Harold Sr. was still with his head back, either asleep or close.
Harold Jr. was thumbing halfheartedly through a magazine and yawning.
Irene already had her briefcase on her lap and was reading through her stack of papers.

I didn't see any obvious openings, so I decided to go fishing.

"Ladies," I addressed row 26, "is there anything I can do to help you get comfortable?"

From the middle seat Abigail gave me a wry smile and paused her fidgeting with her pillow.
"Have you got a secret button that will let these seats fold farther back?"
Her tone was half-kidding, half-not.

I've heard more variations on this than you can count.
There's no good answer, so I've learned to deflect with some humor.

"Sure, but then you'd have your head in his lap," I pointed to Harold Jr. sitting behind her, then to the row in front of her, "and they'd have their heads in your laps."

Abigail raised an eyebrow and turned, dislodging her pillow.
She appraised Harold Jr. through the gap in the seats, then lifted herself to see over her seat at Harold Sr.
She gave a small "not bad" twist to her smile, and faced forward.
She made a show of pushing the button on her armrest and slowly lowering her seat back.

"Hey, I'm game," she said.

Lydia's eyes bulged and she covered her mouth.
Katherine snorted out a laugh and slapped at Abigail's hand.
"Abby!"
She faced me and said, "Don't mind her, she's just tipsy."

Abigail, Abby, pshawed her friend and returned to arranging her pillow.

"How is the temperature?"
I asked.
"Can I get anyone an extra blanket?"

Katherine, clearly the leader, looked at her two friends.
Abby started to say something, but quieted as Katherine leaned over and tucked Abby's blanket around her, cocooning her in place.

"No, I think we're fine here.
Thank you, though."

"Of course.
Sleep tight, ladies."

I stepped to 27 and addressed Harold Jr. and Irene.

"Anything for you two?"

Junior had overheard at least a bit of the conversation as he was shaking his head at the ladies in 26.
He put his magazine into the back of the seat in front of him, careful not to disturb Abby.

"Actually, an extra blanket sounds good," he said.

I pulled one from the storage closet and passed it to him.
He unfolded it and draped it across his father.
The older man stirred but did not wake.
It was a very sweet gesture, and I gained a more genuine smile than I've had in a while.

"Ms. Peters?
Anything for you?"

I hadn't meant to use her name, but I'd been checking off their names in my head, trying to reinforce them in my memory.
It just came out.
She didn't seem to notice or care.
Actually, she looked up in that slow manner that indicated she'd barely heard me.

"Hmm?" she said.

"Do you need anything before lights out?
Extra blanket?
If you'll be up all night, I could get you some coffee."

"That's so sweet.
I hope I won't be up too much longer, but thank you."

I couldn't tell her that she was wrong, nor could I think of anything else to say, so I nodded and walked back to the galley.

It wasn't the most fruitful of exercises.
I didn't get any additional back-story on any of them.
If I'm being generous I'd say that I got a few insights into their personalities that might make it easier to tack on future memories.
But that's a stretch.

_I'll get more in the next loop._

It occurred to me that I was a few hours into loop three.
That means I'd been at this for something like 24 hours straight already.
My headache and appetite continue to grow, but my alertness and fatigue seem to reset with each loop.
Well, for the most part, anyway.

It's a vague inkling right now, but I have the sense that it's getting harder to keep a train of thought.
With all the input I'm trying to keep track of, and juggling and sorting three and four versions of the same events, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that I'm distracted.

For now, I'm going back to my consideration of sight lines.

I grabbed some aspirin from the galley and settled into my jump seat to wait out the weather.

Terry thumped down heavily next to me, once again with his paper.
We sat in a companionable silence, until Terry runs out of things to read.
He pointed at my schoolbook.

"That looks like heavy stuff."

I realized I'd had it open to the same page for at least a half hour.
A giant block-lettered `LOOPS` chapter header stood out at the top of the page.

"It's not so bad once you get used to it," was all I could think to say.

"May I?" he asks, holding his hands out for the thick book.

I pulled my bookmark out from between my thigh and my seat and dropped it into place.

"Sure," I said as I handed over the book which had cost me more than I'd probably make for this entire, unending flight.

He read, tracing his index finger down the page.
Shaking his head, he flipped the pages back until he found the `INTRODUCTION` section at the beginning.
Again, his finger dew slowly down the paper.
Shaking his head and checking the bookmark, he flipped the book closed and handed it back to me.

"Impressive.
I have no idea what any of it means."
His smile seemed genuine.
"I don't know how you can read that without taking notes, though.
Can you actually remember all of it?"

I chuckled.
"When I'm not flying, I take a ton of notes.
But no pockets in the uniforms means no pens or highlighters.
I tried keeping them with the book, but I knew I'd eventually get in trouble for leaving one in a jump seat and didn't want to risk it."

Terry rolled his eyes.
"Tell me about it.
I can't believe they took pockets off these new uniforms.
Just an awful decision."

"Oh?
Did the uniforms have pockets before?"

"Until, uh," he scratched his chin, "about two years ago, yeah.
When they got rid of skirts and put everyone into trousers.
They called it," he curled his fingers in the air, "_unisex design_, but we all knew the real reason."

"What's that?" I asked.

"Fellas kept their wallets in their pockets.
It," again he curled his fingers, "_ruined the lines_.
Someone realized women passengers like to stare at bums as much as men passengers.
So here we are."

"Huh," I say.
I couldn't think of anything else, so I fell back to small talk.
"How long have you worked for HDA?"

His finger and thumb again went to his chin.
"Maybe six years now?  Seven?"

"What did you do before?
If you don't mind me asking."

"No worries—I don't mind.
Professional surfer.
Since I was this big."
He hovered his hand at a height which implied it may have been before he learned how to walk.

He looked like he wanted to continue, so I sat quiet and waited.

"Blew out my knee about ten years ago.
I was in L.A. for a small comp.
Too small, really.
After I'd already been through three surgeries, there was a problem with the insurance, and I was stuck in the U.S."

His face tightened, but he kept going.

"There were also some family problems back home, so there wasn't anything really left for me there, anyway.
I stayed here, bouncing around a few odd jobs until I got solid on my feet again.
I always enjoyed traveling for comps, so I thought this job might be close enough."

Looking to redirect from what was clearly a painful memory, I asked, "How long have you, Pamela, and Archie been flying together?"

"Maybe a year now?
A bit less, I think."

His mood shifted at the mention of Archie.

"I want to head forward to check on something, if you don't mind.
You okay back here for a while?"

The FSB was still on for the weather, but he knew this as well as I did.
I nodded, and he unbuckled and walked away without another word.
