# The Importance Of

“I need you to unbuckle and come with me,” I whispered into Ernest’s ear.

“Is there a problem?”
He didn’t move.

I didn’t respond.
I stood up and stared at him, extending my hand as if to present the Smoking section to him.

“Right this way, sir,” I said for the audience.

One look at Mary told me all that I needed to know.
There was no rise and fall of her blankets as she breathed.
I let my gaze linger on her, then over to Ernest, to underline the situation.

It was detente, our own little Cold War right there in the aisle.
Except that no one else could see the growing anger on his face, and what they could see of mine looked as pleasant as ever.

He unbuckled and rose, hunching to avoid the overhead.
I walked behind him to the First Class.

Pamela was in the galley on the intercom phone talking to, I assumed, Terry in the Coach galley.
She was pale, staring at us as we passed.

“I need to chat with Mr. Dearborn,”
I said to her, escorting him past to the forward exit.
“Can you make sure we’re not disturbed?”
It meant the First Class passengers just waking up would have to use the Coach lavatories.
Pamela frowned, but I kept walking and didn’t give her the opportunity to object.

Dearborn spun on his heel as we approached the exit, leaning in to intimidate me.
In my heels I was just as tall as him, if not quite as wide.
I didn’t flinch.

“What the—”

“You will keep your voice down,” I interrupted, holding up a finger to shush him.

“Now you listen—”

“I will listen.
I will listen as you tell me what is so precious in that briefcase of yours.”

He rocked back as if I had slapped him.

“What did you say?”

“What’s in those folders with the rubber bands?”

This time he actually took a step back, bumping into the wall.

“How do you …”
He pointed an accusatory finger at me.
“Did you go through my things?”

He pushed forward, as if to pass me and march back to his seat.
I put up both hands, daring him to try to get past.

“No, another passenger took them.”

The color drained out of him as he fell back against the wall.

“Tell me what’s in those files.”
It was my turn to point an accusatory finger.
“What’s worth killing people for?”

His eyes looked like they would pop out of his sockets and he began to choke, sobbing.

“You can’t … how … I had to …”

Another push was on the tip of my tongue when my brain caught up with what he’d said.

“You had to do what?”

He blubbered, incoherent and beaten against the wall.
“They.
Made.
Me.”
The words came out one at a time through chokes and sniffles.

“Who made you do it?
What did you do?”

“Didn’t.
Want.
To.”

My hands were at the lapels of his suit jacket before I knew what I was doing, the fabric bunched in my grip.
I pulled him bodily away from the wall and back up to face me.

“We don’t have time for this.
Talk or we all die.”

“Die?
What?
All?”

I’ve never hit anyone in my life.
Had you asked me yesterday, I would have told you I was incapable of it.
But I did it.

I hauled off and smacked Ernest Dearborn across the cheek loud enough that everyone in First Class probably heard it.
My hand drew back for a second strike of its own accord, and only the sight of him cowering under his raised arm brought me back to my senses.
My palm stung with warm tingles, while my wrist felt like I had pulled something.

I released my other hand’s grip on his lapel, stepping back from him.
My hands went into my apron pocket where one found the cool metal of the detonator.

“Ernest,” I said, quiet and calm, “this is important.
Take a moment.
Breathe.
You can talk when you’re ready.
In fact, stay right here,” I pointed to his feet, “and I’ll get you some water.”

He didn’t acknowledge me, he just stared at his hands in front of him.

I poured him a cup of water in the galley, ignoring Pamela’s questions as well as the clocks.
I had to wrap Ernest’s hands around the cup to get him to take it.

“Ernest.”
I repeated his name until I got a response.
“Ernest.
Ernest.
Ernest.
Take a drink, Ernest.
It will help.”

His breathing slowed until he had himself under control.
He sipped at his water, looking anywhere but at me.

“Talk to me Ernest.
Please.
I can’t fix it if I don’t know what’s going on.”

“It’s too late,” he said, his voice cracking again.
“You can’t fix it now.”

“Why not?”

“You saw why!”
He was on the point of tears again.
“She’s already gone!”

“Okay,” I tried to calm him.
“I know.
But tell me what happened, anyway.”

“I killed her.
So did you!
We both killed her.”

“What do you m—
Oh, Ernest.
Her pills?”

He nodded.

But that happened before the started of each loop.
I can’t change that.

“What was in the pills?”

He shook his head, a death grip on the cup.
“I don’t know.”

“What did they do?”

“They were … They unbalanced her.
Made her forget things.
Made her seem incompetent.
They weren’t supposed to kill her!”
His voice spun up and his hands began to shake again.

“Breathe, Ernest.
Just breathe.”
As slow as I could, I took my left hand out of my apron pocket and touched his wrist.
“You can’t change it now.
I need you to tell me what was in your briefcase.”

His eyes went wide again.

“I—
I cant.”

“I know it was some kind of paperwork.
I don’t need to know details, I just need to know why it was important.
Please, Ernest.”

Struggling with it, his grip tightened on his foam cup until it shattered in his hands, water falling to the floor and dripping down his arms.

“It was secrets.
Some ours.
Some … not.”

“Secrets?
Who do you work for?
The government?
Defense contractors?
Who?”

Ernest ducked and raised his shoulders, equivocating.

“NASA.”
