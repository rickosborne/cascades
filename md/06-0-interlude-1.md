# Siberia, Summer 1908

The woman staggered into the clearing around the small hut.
Without trees to support her, the woman's steps became more erratic until she finally fell to her knees, still clutching her head.

The man scaling and gutting fish didn't notice her and continued his work.

"Papa," the woman croaked.
It wasn't loud enoughâ€”he didn't hear her.
She tried to stand but her knees wouldn't support her.
Groaning with the effort, she pulled her hands away from her temples to raise herself into a crawl.
There was a cost and she froze in place, panting and willing her elbows to be more reliable than her knees.

"Papa," the groan was louder this time.
She saw him look up from his fish without stopping.
The pounding in her head told her she was screaming his name, but it was still lost on the gentle breeze.

A final "Papa!" was enough to turn him toward her as the effort drove her again to the ground.

The man dropped the fish and knife into the grass as he ran to her.

"Niura!" she heard him yell as she rolled onto her back.

One hand went to her forehead while the other raised above the grass to help her father find her.
"Here, papa," was all she could manage in a hoarse whisper.
"Here."

She felt him hit the ground next to her.

The next thing she was aware of was the smell of their _chum_: smoky reindeer hides and fish.
The sun was off her head, though the light coming through her eyelids was from the day, not a fire.

Her head still pounded and her palms went to it without thought.

"Niura, be still."

Despite her pain, the voice made the woman smile.
"Papa."

"What happened to you?"
He dripped water from a skin into her mouth.
"_Chulugdy_?"

The word came from the man as a joke that wasn't funny.

"I'm not a child anymore."

She opened her eyes to see him brushing off her reply.
He was still crouching over her as he sighed in resignation and the fermented smell of his breath was strong.
She tensed and tried to clear her head.

"What of the _argish_?
Why are you alone?"

"They are gone, papa."

"Gone?"
She head the edge in his voice, off balance and teetering between fear for his daughter and anger at her loss.

"They were taken."

"Taken?"
The man was on his feet in an unsteady blur.
"By who?"

She fumbled with the word that had been repeating in her head for the last two weeks.
She still had trouble believing it, though she had seen it with her own eyes.

"Seveki."

Her father's mouth moved without sound.

"I swear, papa.
I saw it happen.
The entire _argish_."

"Tell me!" her father demanded, dropping back to her side.

She moved as if to sit up, but the throbbing in her head prevented it.

"I drove the _argish_ up the river, as we discussed.
We'd just come to the the hills when Seveki came."
She shuddered with the memory.
"The reindeer and I were watering, but we must have angered him.
He yelled and pushed me into the river.
I moved to swim to the shore, but the air burned with his arrival.
I had to stay under the water to avoid his wrath."

Her eyes locked onto his, she searching for acknowledgement and he searching for lies.

"But I could not hide from his wrath for long.
When I came to the surface, he threw rocks at me."
She pointed at the cuts running along her hair and across her arms.
Some of them still had grit in them.

"It was then that I saw the reindeer.
They were dead.
All of them.
Seveki took their souls as punishment for hiding from him."

He looked like he didn't believe her.

"Didn't you hear him, papa?
He was so loud."

The man fell onto his backside.

"_Khalganchuluk_ rattled the _chum_ this morning."
He looked abashed.
"I was not awake, so I yelled at him to go away.
But maybe it was Seveki, as you say."

"This morning?
No, papa, this was days ago.
Ten?  Maybe twelve?"

His consideration evaporated and he squinted at her.
"_Khalganchuluk_ was here this morning.
And you only took the _argish_ the day before yesterday.
What are you talking about?"

"Two days?"
She muttered as she pressed her wrists even tighter to her temples.
"That cannot be.
The visions ..."

"Do not call me a liar!"
The reprimand was harsh in the small space and a fresh wave of hot, fermented breath rolled across her.
"And what is this of visions?"

Niura's eyes watered as confusion gripped her.

"Seveki taunted me, papa.
I do not mean to call you a liar.
He confused me."

She thought this would placate him, but her words only made is jaw tighten.
She continued, but she felt her breathing quicken to match her father's.

"Each night he challenged me.
And when I failed," her words broke, "he brought me back to the river to show me the dead _argish_.
Every night."

"There were only two!"
The man's fists clenched and pressed into his thighs.

"I cannot explain it, father.
Seveki threw me down a hill, then put me back at the river.
When I avoided the hill he sent a bear to maul me, then I awoke from the dead with the _argish_ dead around me.
I crept past the bear but slipped in some mud ... and back to the _argish_."

He pointed an unsteady hand at her cut flesh.
"These are not from a bear.
And you have no mud on you.
Lies!
Did you steal my _argish_?"

Her heart raced as the pitch of his voice rose to match his widening eyes.
Niura crossed her arms in front of her to ward off the blow she knew was coming.

And then the daylight flooded her eyes and she could smell the river.
She had failed Seveki again.
