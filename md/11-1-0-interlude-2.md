# Siberia, Autumn 1918

## Ten years after the Tunguska Event

Niura's chest itched where the reindeer-leather bag touched it.
It had no reason to itch—she'd made the bag herself, almost ten years ago, and knew it had not a single hair remaining.
But it itched anyway, her shirt pressing the bag against her as it dangled from a woven leather necklace.

The bag didn't itch because she'd made it poorly.
It itched because the man sitting across from her made it itch.
She had visions of jamming her hand down her shirt, rubbing the bag in her fingers, and dragging its small window across her skin.
The tiny spur of rock which peeked through the side of the bag would feel cool, smooth, and familiar against her.

But that wouldn't help her here and now.
She needed to keep him talking while she figured out what to do next.

"What did you say his name was?"
Niura's words were slow, her pronunciation clear.
While looking at the man across from her, who did not look like her or speak Evenki, she directed her question to the translator next to him.
The translator was Even, not Evenk, so while his accent was thick, they could at least converse.

"Mr. Hamish."

The untrustworthy old man nodded at the mention of his name.

"And who is he?"

"Mr. Hamish is gathering stories.
He wishes to take them back to his home, and tell them to many of his people.
He is interested in what happened over the Tunguska River ten years ago."

Niura worked to keep her voice friendly and her smile in place.
Her next words were directed at Hamish.

"Ten years ago?
What do you mean?"

The translator, he'd said his name, but she'd been caught off guard and didn't remember it, passed along her words.
The response from Hamish was brief, and quickly translated.
Niura was able to pick out a Russian word here and there, but not enough to follow either man as they spoke.

"How long have you lived in this area?
Were you here ten years ago?"

Niura did not like talking to anyone about that day.
And she didn't know these men.
But she was not well-traveled beyond Evenk lands, so a lie would be easily caught.

"I have lived between the rivers my entire life."
She spread her arms wide to encompass all around her, but also to stop herself from fidgeting.

Hamish smiled at the translation and something behind his eyes looked hungry.
He had paper and ink and readied them as he spoke.

"On a morning ten years ago a great force knocked down many trees and burned the sky.
Did you see it?"

Niura could not stop her hand from touching the faint white scars that ran from her eyes into her black hair.
She felt ashamed at the impulse, but also glad that dressing for the cool weather covered up the matching scars on her arms.
The scars were faint, but she knew the flickering firelight would highlight them.

"Yes, I saw it.
I remember."

Hamish poised above the paper, ready to take notes.
"Can you tell me what happened?"

She would tell him a story of her every day.
It would not be interesting and he would leave.

"I was driving my _argish_ along the river."

The translator help up a hand, struggling to keep pace.
Hamish let a look of annoyance toward the translator slip across his face as the translator turned back to Niura.

"What is _argish_?"

"My herd.
When we move together it is _argish_."

The translator nodded and said a single word to Hamish.

"Excuse me, I missed your name."

"Khadiul," said the Even man, placing his hands on his belt.
He seemed to expect that the name meant something to her.

"Thank you, Khadiul."
A brief pause and nod, and she was back to her story.
"We cannot follow the river the entire way, as the animals will get distracted and hard to move.
But we had stopped for water before the hills."

Niura struggled to keep her manner casual as she raced ahead to figure out which parts to tell and how.
The slow pace of translation helped.

"I heard a scream like I have never heard.
I was washing my face, and as I looked up from the water there was an even louder noise.
And ..."

Khadiul nodded his appreciation for the pause while he continued to speak.

"And?"

"And I was pushed into the river.
As the water took me I felt it get hot around me, like I was a root in a soup.
It was cooler below, so I swam out into the river and followed the bottom."

"You know how to swim?"

Niura felt it was an odd question, especially from an Even, but she could not tell which of them was asking.

"I have lived between the rivers my entire life."

Khadiul blinked at her before saying something to Hamish, who continued to write without looking up.
She went on, finishing her story.

"The water was not cool before I had to breathe.
But it was not just the water that was corrupted: my animals were all dead.
I went to each of them, but none survived.
So I journeyed home, told my father, and we struggled to build a new herd before the winter."

She sat, waiting for the two men to catch up.
The story was told and collected and that would be the end of it.

"The animals were reindeer?"

"Of course."
The people of the Even were horse herders, but while the Evenks worked almost exclusively with reindeer.
But Niura allowed that the clarification was reasonable.

"Did you see the sky when this happened?"

Niura had seen the sky.
The tracks of Seveki's sled had not entirely blown away by the time she had checked the animals.
But she was not going to bring Seveki into this, especially not with the outsider.

"I did not.
I was in the river, then I was clearing water from my eyes, and then I was concerned with my animals."

Both men looked disappointed, Hamish pausing in his writing to look at her.

"Is that all?"

"It was for me.
Unless you would like to hear stories of the many seasons it took to recover?
Of how my father and I survived them?"

"Another time.
What of your father?
Would he have a story of that day?"

Niura was glad to be able to tell the entire truth for this part.

"No.
He was drunk the night before and slept through the morning.
He said he heard something but thought it was a dream."

"Could we speak with him?"

Niura's hand went to her chest, involuntary.
She caught herself and moved to cover her heart instead of the pouch.

"He died three years ago."

"I see," said Khadiul.

The questions abated while Hamish scratched across the paper in his strange writing.
Niura's tension ebbed away.
It was almost over.

"Mr. Hamish did have one more question, but I have told him that it may be inappropriate.
I am not sure if I have the skill to ask it correctly."

Niura nodded at him to continue.

"We have talked with many Evenks these past weeks.
The stories are all similar.
It seems like your people came together to recover.
We heard just as many stories telling of hardships and luck and through them all we see a tight fishing net of people."

He laced his fingers together, showing her the knot.
Then he shrugged and pointed at her, signaling the difficult part.

"You were here.
You suffered and survived.
But your story is not woven with the rest of the fishing net.
When people say your name it is quiet, and it is not part of the coming together.
Why is that?"

He paused, unable to find the words, giving up with another shrug.  "Why do the other Evenks think you are cursed?"

Niura saw where these tracks led.

"My father and I were more solitary than most, even before we lost our herd.
He preferred to spend his nights in a drunken stagger, which meant I had more work than most my age, tending to our animals.
Still today, I do not have the time to sit with the others and talk, so I get stranger and stranger to them."

Khadiul spoke as she did, but was restless and squinted at her.
Her answer did not satisfy him.

"Do you know some others say you can read their thoughts?
That you are cursed because you sneak into their dreams at night?
That you know things you should not know?"

Niura laughed aloud at this.
The others would have had a harder time knowing the truth than believing something so wild.

"I am not surprised.
I speak my mind and say things others would like to but will not.
It does not mean I have visions—it means only that I am not used to talking with others.
I have survived alone for more years than my father has been gone."

Her laughter from only seconds before curdled into contempt.
Her people were so ungrateful.
They would never know how much work she had put into keeping them going, all of them, these past ten years.
Without her efforts, these two men would be digging through the corpses of the Evenks instead of digging through their stories.

But neither her people nor these outsiders could ever know.

The words of Khadiul snapped something inside her.
No one had said these things out loud, but she had already known how the other Evenks thought of her.
Yes, everyone was nice to her face, and willing to share a fire.
But there were too many whispered conversations and side glances.

Niura was done with it.
She just needed to figure out what to do next.

Neither Khadiul nor Hamish seemed satisfied with her explanation, as the former finished his translation.

Seeking to change the subject, she asked, "Khadiul, is that Russian you are speaking?"

The man's frown pursed as he nodded.
"Mr. Hamish and I have just enough Russian between us to make ourselves known.
But it is not much, as he is not Russian, and mine is poor.
He speaks and writes something he calls English, but it is nonsense."

Hamish popped his head up, stopping his pen at the familiar word, looking to Khadiul.
Niura was curious about his writing, and reached to turn a few of the dried pages toward her.
Hamish did not seem to object as the two men talked.
His writing was mostly a small scrawl, but Niura thought she could pick out some symbols which looked very much like the Russian words she had seen on packaged goods and signs.
But something was a little different—maybe the words were shorter, or less complex.

A commotion broke out behind her, causing all three to turn and look.

A very young girl, maybe a handful of years old, dropped to the ground, bawling.
She had dirty yellow hair that shone in the sun, frizzed out in a halo around a pale face and bright blue eyes.
She wailed and shook, her skin blotchy and her breath coming in loud gasps.
The man beside her, dark-haired and in what Niura believed to be a Russian military uniform, clearly had no idea what to do to comfort her.

Both Niura and Hamish were on their feet at the same time.
Niura reached the girl first, scooping her up while looking at the military man.
She would not normally be so forward, but she felt certain this man was not the girl's father or guardian.
Without thinking, she found a strip of jerky from her belt pouch and pressed it into the girl's clenched fists.
Leaning in to nibble at it, she locked eyes with the girl and encouraged her to do the same.
This calmed the girl a little, her keens reducing to sobs.

As the three men spoke, Hamish became increasingly agitated, almost matching the girl.
The military man shrugged in response to almost each one of the questions the other two asked.
Exasperated, he handed over a small shoulder bag to Khadiul, pulling out a folded piece of paper to give to Hamish.

Niura looked into the bag as Khadiul opened it.
She saw some bright cloth, matching the quality of the girl's outfit.
Khadiul rummaged around, pulling items to the top.
A handful of colorful carved wooden blocks were clearly children's toys, albeit boring ones.
A tiny pair of shoes, a white match to the black ones currently on the girl's feet.
Some small books, where the print on them looked closer to Hamish's writing than to Russian.
Khadiul flipped through one, showing Niura that each page contained a large writing symbol along with some other words, and drawings of strange animals and little children.

Moving around to look at the paper as Hamish read it, she saw it was machine-printed.
The top half had symbols which matched the book, while the bottom half had symbols which she was certain were Russian.
Hamish's big thumbs covered much of the Russian text, so she supposed he was reading the top half.
Maybe it was the English which Khadiul had mentioned?
Seeing it next to Russian, she disagreed with his assertion it was nonsense—the symbols were similar enough.

The girl had stopped crying, content with her jerky, drool running down to her colorful outfit.
Niura continued to bounce and coo at her.

Khadiul, now holding the paper, spoke in his accented Evenki as his eyes followed the Russian writings.

"This girl's parents died while the family was traveling.
The railroad is trying to get her back home, to the other family they believe she has there, but cannot spare the people to help."
Looking up from the paper to Niura, but waving at hand at the military man, he continued.
"This soldier has accompanied her for the last two days, but admits he does not know how to handle children and grows weary of her."

Hamish said something in Russian to the military man which caused the latter's shoulders to slump in relief.
They shook hands, and the uniformed man picked up his much larger bag and walked away without giving the girl a second glance.
The older man turned to look at Niura and the now-quiet girl, appraising them both.
He said something to Khadiul, causing the Even man's eyes to go wide.

"Mr. Hamish would like to propose an arrangement with you, Niura."
