# Siberia, FIXME date

Niura's chest itched where the reindeer-leather bag touched it.
It had no reason to itch—she'd made the bag herself and knew it had not a single hair remaining.
But it itched anyway, her shirt pressing the bag against her as it dangled from a woven leather necklace.

The bag didn't itch because she'd made it poorly.
It itched because the man sitting across from her made it itch.
She had visions of jamming her hand down her shirt, ripping the cord from her neck, and smashing the bag against her palm.
She wouldn't even have to fumble to open the pouch—the rock inside was sharp enough that it would rip through the thin leather.

But even that wouldn't help here and now.
She needed to keep him talking while she figured out what to do next.

"What did you say his name was?"
Niura's words were slow, her pronunciation clear.
While looking at the man across from her who did not speak FIXME Evenki she director her question to the FIXME Even translator next to him.

"Mr. FIXME."

At the mention of his name, the untrustworthy man nodded.

"And who is he?"

"Mr. FIXME is gathering stories.
He is interested in what happened over the Tunguska River ten years ago."

Niura worked to keep her voice friendly and her smile in place.
Her next words were directed at FIXME.

"Ten years ago?
What do you mean?"

The translator, he'd said his name but she'd been caught off guard and didn't remember it, passed along her words.
FIXME's response was brief.

"How long have you lived in this area?
Were you here ten years ago?"

Niura did not like talking to anyone about her time with Seveki.
And she didn't know these men.
But it was not like her people were well-traveled, so a lie would be easily caught.

"I have lived between the rivers my entire life."
She spread her arms wide to encompass all around her, but also to stop herself from fidgeting.

FIXME smiled at the translation and something behind his eyes looked hungry.
He had paper and ink and readied them as he spoke.

"On a morning ten years ago a great force knocked down many trees and burned the sky.
Did you see it?"

Niura could not stop her hand from touching the faint scars that ran from her eyes into her hair.
She felt ashamed at the impulse, but also glad that dressing for the cool weather covered up the matching scars on her arms.
The scars were faint, but she knew the flickering firelight would highlight them.

"Yes, I saw it.
I remember."

FIXME poised above the paper, ready to take notes.
"Can you tell me what happened?"

She would tell him a story of her every day.
It would not be interesting and he would leave.

"I was driving my _argish_ along the river."

The translator help up a hand, struggling to keep pace.
FIXME let a look of annoyance toward the translator slip across his face as the translator turned back to Niura.

"What is _argish_?"

"My herd.
When we move together it is _argish_."

The translator nodded and said a single word to FIXME.

"Excuse me, I missed your name."

"TRANSLATOR," said the Even, placing his hands on his belt.
He seemed to expect that the name meant something to her.

"Thank you, TRANSLATOR."
A brief pause and nod and she was back to her story.
"We cannot follow the river the entire way, as the animals will get distracted and hard to move.
But we had stopped for water before the hills."

Niura struggled to keep her manor casual as she raced ahead to figure out which parts to tell and how.
The slow pace of translation helped.

"I heard a scream like I have never heard.
I was washing my face, and as I looked up from the water there was an even louder noise.
And ..."

TRANSLATOR nodded his appreciation for the pause while he continued to speak.

"And?"

"And I was pushed into the river.
As the water took me I felt it get hot around me, like I was a root in a soup.
It was cooler below, so I swam out into the river and followed the bottom."

"You know how to swim?"

Niura felt it was an odd question, especially from an Even, but she could not tell which of them was asking.

"I have lived between the rivers my entire life."

TRANSLATOR blinked at her before saying something to FIXME, who continued to write without looking up.
She went on, finishing her story.

"The water was not cool before I had to breathe.
But it was not just the water that was corrupted: my animals were all dead.
I went to each of them, but none survived.
So I journeyed home, told my father, and we struggled to build a new herd before the winter."

She sat, waiting for the two men to catch up.
The story was told and collected and that would be the end of it.

"The animals were reindeer?"

"Of course."
The Even were horse herders, but the Evenki worked almost exclusively with reindeer.
But Niura allowed that the clarification was reasonable.

"Did you see the sky when this happened?"

Niura had seen the sky.
The tracks of Seveki's sled had not entirely blown away by the time she had checked the animals.
But she was not going to bring Seveki into this, especially not with the outsider.

"I did not.
I was in the river, then I was clearing water from my eyes, and then I was concerned with my _argish_."

Both men looked disappointed, FIXME pausing in his writing to look at her.

"Is that all?"

"It was for me.
Unless you would like to hear stories of the many seasons it took to recover?
Of how my father and I survived them?"

"Another time.
What of your father?
Would he have a story of that day?"

Niura was glad to be able to tell the entire truth.

"No.
He was drunk the night before and slept through the morning.
He said he heard something but thought it was a dream."

"Could we speak with him?"

Niura's hand went to her chest, involuntary.
She caught herself and moved to cover her heart instead of the pouch.

"He died three years ago."

"I see," said TRANSLATOR.

The questions abated while FIXME scratched across the paper in his strange writing.
Niura's tension ebbed away.
It was almost over.

"We did have one more question, but I have told Mr. FIXME that it may be inappropriate.
I do not have the skill to ask it correctly."

Niura nodded at him to continue.

"We have talked to many Evenki these past weeks.
The stories are all similar.
It seems like your people came together to recover.
We heard just as many stories telling of hardships and luck and through them all we see a tight fishing net of people."

He shrugged, signaling the difficult part.

"You were here.
You suffered and survived.
But your story is not woven with the rest of the fishing net.
When people say your name it is quiet, and it is not part of the coming together.
Why ... ?"

He paused, unable to find the words, giving up with another shrug.
Niura saw where these tracks led.

"Why do the other Evenki think you are cursed?"

"My father and I were more solitary than most before we lost our herd.
He preferred to spend his nights in a drunken stagger, which meant I had more work than most my age, tending to our animals.
I do not have the time to sit with the others and talk, so I get stranger and stranger to them."

TRANSLATOR spoke as she did, but was restless.
Her answer did not satisfy him.

"Do you know some others say you can read their thoughts?
That you are cursed because you sneak into their dreams at night?
That you know things you should not know?"

Niura laughed aloud at this.
The others would have had a harder time knowing the truth than believing something so wild.

"I am not surprised.
I speak my mind and say things others would like to but will not.
I does not mean I have visions—it means only that I am not used to talking to others.
I have survived alone for more years than my father has been gone."

Her laughter from only seconds before curdled into contempt.
They were so ungrateful.
They would never know how much work she had put into keeping them going, all of them, these past ten years.
Without her efforts, these men would be digging through the corpses of the Evenki instead of digging through their stories.

But neither her people nor these outsiders could ever know.
