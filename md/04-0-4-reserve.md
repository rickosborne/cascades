# Reserve

I should explain reserve. 
I'm not doing a very good job at narrating, sorry.

I'm what we call "reserve crew". 
Most crew fly the same _lines_: sequences of flights that usually start and end at the same place so that the crew can feel like they have some semblance of a place to call home. 
Good lines are jealously coveted, and are doled out based on your seniority. 
Since I've only been in the air for six months, I have almost no chance of getting even a decent line.

Instead, I fly reserve, which means that I fly when other crew can't or won't. 
Sometimes it's because they're sick, sometimes it's because they're no longer legal—the FAA has very strict regulations about how much we can work, how often, and how long, and weather can play havoc with it—or any number of other reasons.

I get a call, which I have to return in under 15 minutes, and I have to be at the airport and ready to go in under two hours. 
More often than not they want me there even faster than that. 
Sometimes I get called into an airport because weather is going crazy and it's almost a sure thing that at least a few other crew won't be legal to finish their line after they land. 
I might sit in a chair, reading my textbook, for four hours before I'm told to go back home, or told to catch a shuttle to a nearby airport because I'm finally needed elsewhere.

Reserve isn't something everyone can handle. 
I don't mind it so much because, to be honest, I don't make the interpersonal connections that most other attendants do. 
I almost never work with the same crew more than a few days in a row. 
HDA isn't a huge airline, but we do fly to enough places that I can go a week or two before working with the same crew a second time.

Terry and Pamela's usual third is a woman named Archie. 
I think I've worked with her before—that's a unique enough name that it's hard to forget. 
She'd been all but kicked off of the plane when it landed in Seattle earlier this evening. 
She was fighting a stomach flu that was serious enough to have her in a lavatory for a third of the Lansing-Seattle flight, according to Terry. 
He and Pamela had dragged her off the plane, frog-marched her to the airport hotel, checked her in, and refused to let her leave the room until she'd finally succumbed to the medications they'd pumped into her.

I got the call just as I'd started Chapter 13 and was out the door within ten minutes. 
Flying reserve, you get used to being ready to go with a minimum of fuss.

But there was a hitch: I wasn't quite legal yet. 
I'd only just landed in Seattle that morning, so I needed another hour and change before I was allowed to be in the air again.

_I_ was the reason the plane sat on the tarmac for an extra hour and a half.

Okay, well, technically it wasn't me. 
If you looked at it the right way, I was the reason these people were in the air instead of sleeping in Sea-Tac because their flight was cancelled or rescheduled for the following morning.

So when the plane blew up just before sunrise, somewhere off the gulf coast of Florida, I was the reason everyone was dropping several miles into the ocean.
