# FateCode Introduction

> Dear reader.
> Parts of this book involve a some very basic computer programming to help Lily make choices and keep track of events.
> The programming language is called _fate:code_ and is tailored for this purpose.
>
> Don't worry, even if you've never programmed before the new parts of the language will be explained as they are used.
>
> You'll need a writing instrument and a bookmark you can write on.
> An index card or a folded sheet of paper could work well, but you could probably make do with the back of a receipt.
> If you don't want to write on your bookmark you could use the back cover of this book.
> But please don't do that if this book isn't yours.
>
> You'll start off with only one _fate:code_ command for now: `JUMP`.
> The `JUMP` command instructs you to skip to another page of the book.
> You won't need to keep your place, so don't worry about your bookmark for now.
>
> You'll also notice that the page number after `JUMP` looks a little weird.
> It's in hexadecimal, which counts using base 16 instead of base 10.
> If you've never seen it before don't worry it's simple: when counting you follow `0`, `1`, `2` .. to `9`, then `A`, `B`, etc, through `F`, then back to `0`.
> This means the number after `109` is `10A`, and the number after `2F` is `30`.
> For the most part just remember that letters follow numbers when you are trying to find the right page.
>
> Chunks of programming source code are called _blocks_.
> All _fate:code_ blocks will be stylized like the one below so they're easy to find and notice.
