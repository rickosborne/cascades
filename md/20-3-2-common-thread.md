# Common Thread

I've got it figured out.

It took me well into beverage service, but I figured out the commonality between the three explosions.

At the time of the third explosion I was walking forward to First Class and was almost to the Smoking section.
Terry was working his way backwards to meet me.
Pamela was in First Class.

For the second explosion I was in a tail lavatory, while Terry and Pamela were in First Class.

The first explosion found Pamela and me in First Class.
I don't know exactly where Terry was, but I had a good guess: the galley or a lavatory.
I can't prove it, but it's probable.
We've had the same passengers use the lavatories each day, so it was likely the same person disabling the smoke detector each morning, with Terry going back to fix it each time.
Or just as likely, maybe Terry was walking around collecting trash and was in the same place I'd just been.

In all three cases, the flight attendants were out of view of the aft portion of Coach.
None of us could see the explosion.
The common thread isn't _when_ the explosion happened but _who_ wasn't around to see it.

It's the only thing that fits.

It also explains the variable timing: the bomber was waiting to detonate only when they couldn't be seen.

The thing I haven't figured out is how to see what the bomber doesn't want me to see.
The location of the explosion is well-chosen if sight lines are a consideration.
If I'm standing with my back to the aft galley wall, I can't see more than a few inches of 27C, the seat on the aisle.
With the wall where it is, I'd have to be standing almost in line with row 27 to be able to see 27A.

I can't see it from the front, either.
The curtain separating Smoking from Non is a brown and gold number heavy enough to keep most smoke out but sheer enough to be able to see general outlines on the opposite side.
The 707 doesn't have the mid-body galley that some 747 builds use, so there isn't anywhere to stand between the fore and aft galleys where I wouldn't look conspicuous.

I've got two and a half hours before we're clear of the weather.
In that time I need to come up with a way to see what someone doesn't want me to see.
