# Author's Note & Content Warnings

This work of fiction is a suspense or thriller.
It includes:

* Brief mentions of blood.
* Minor descriptions of injuries resulting from blunt traumas and lacerations.
* A few scenes with moderate physical violence.
* Some references to non-violent death.
* Oblique references to off-page abusive violence by a parent.
* Brief references to off-page implied misogyny in the 1960s and 1970s.

In the author's opinion, none of these items are particularly gory or graphic.
Having said that, the author also encourages the reader to stay safe.
And, of course, don't read anything you don't enjoy.

One last thing before the story, but it's a bit of a spoiler.
Skip ahead to Chapter 1 if you want to go in completely cold.

Still here?

...

Okay.

...

The point-of-view character in this story is Alex.
Neither Alex's gender nor physical presentation are explicitly identified in the story.
There is no canonical gender or presentation for Alex.
There's no "right" Alex.

The author has tried to ensure you, the reader, can imagine Alex however you want.

This lack of explicit gender is not intended to imply Alex is non-binary in the 1970sâ€”instead that Alex is whatever gender and presentation you choose.
(A non-binary Alex is perfectly fine, if that's where your mind goes!)

The author is not trying to make any statements with this treatment of the Alex character.
It is mentioned here because the author assumes some readers will find the lack of canon to be frustrating.
In such a case, pick a gender for a flight attendant and go with it.
It'll be fine, no matter what you choose.
