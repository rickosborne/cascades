# Miami, October 1950

"The storm intensified after leaving Cuba three days ago.
While winds of up to 65 miles per hour were observed there, Miami saw almost double that when it made landfall there, with sustained winds of 125 miles per hour at the airport.
It will take some time to assess the damages.
If you can hunker down and stay indoors today and tomorrow, that will give emergency services the chance to help those who really need—"

Nora flipped off the radio, silencing it.
"Come on," she said, "let's get some food down."

Mary looked at the spread on their dining table.
With the electricity out, they had emptied their refrigerator.
The piles of food ran the gamut from chicken wings to smoked ham to potato and fruit salads and more.
Pitchers of lemonade, iced tea, grapefruit, and orange juices clustered in the center.

Ignoring all that, Nora put down an already-full plate in front of Mary.
"Stick to the simple stuff for now.
Trust me."
The plate had several dinner rolls, a wedge of cheddar cheese, and some mashed potatoes reheated on the gas range.

Mary's eyes bounced between the plate, the pile of chicken wings, and her mother.
Tearing off a hunk of bread, she dragged it through the potatoes and chewed it down without any fanfare.

Nora watched, also considering the chicken wings before making up the same plate as her daughter.
Between mouthfuls, she put her hand on Mary's shoulder.

"Today should be nice and easy, with everyone stuck inside.
The perfect day for you to try.
We'll play some cards and graze all day."

Mary nodded, but was quiet.
Solemn.
Like an athlete preparing mentally for a competition.

The two finished their plates, which Nora quickly rinsed and put in the drying rack.
She plucked a clean plate from the same rack and set it down in front of the younger woman.

"Ready?"

Mary's tan paled by several shades, but she nodded.
"Ready."

Her mother didn't produce the leather bag Mary was expecting.
The one which had been worn against the older woman's chest for decades.

Instead, the necklace in her mother's hand was a thick silver chain, with what looked like a bulbous silver pendant.
A closer look revealed the pendant opened like a locket, revealing an oblong shard of polished stone laced with veins of crystal.

"I know my bag would have offended your fashion sense," her mother said.
"I hope this is at least a little better."

Mary stared at the item.
The design was fine, and well-made.
It was beautiful, really.
But it was also solid, and there, in front of her, which meant that this was all real and happening.

Closing the pendant's clasp back together, Nora cupped Mary's hands together and poured the necklace into them.

"Open the pendant, rub the stone against your shirt for a few seconds, then touch it with your finger."

Mary had never seen her mother do this, so she listened and did as instructed.
As she touched the stone, a jolt ran up her arm, numbing her fingertips.
She dropped the assembly to the table, sliding her fingers and thumb together, trying to chase the sensation.

Nora smiled at her.
"Just like that.
When you get feeling back in your fingers, put on the necklace.
I'd offer to help, but you'll want to get in the habit of doing it yourself when I'm not around."

"Is it always like that?"

"You get used to it, but yes.
Remember, though: it takes several minutes to do whatever it does."

"Right."

Nora had never seen what this looked like from the outside, and was cautiously curious to see if she could tell.
She'd had return points in the middle of conversations, probably dozens of them, and knew her re-arrival occasionally drew strange looks from others.

There was no mistaking this one.

One moment, the thirty-six-year-old was breathing calmly, hands flat on the table, staring at her mother.
The next moment, her hands shot to her temples and she was hyperventilating.
Nora bolted to her feet and stood behind her daughter, enveloping her in a hug, whispering in her ear.

"You're here with me, now.
I've got you.
Just breathe.
I've got you."

Mary slipped into a shuddering sob.
Her hands fell from her temples to her heart, which Nora could feel hammering in her chest.

"I— I don't think— I don't think I should do that again."
Mary began to stutter, which she hadn't done since her teenage years.
"M- m- my. H- h- heart.  I c- c- can't."

Nora pulled the woman and her chair back from the table, dropping to kneel in front of her.

"You're safe.
You're here with me now.
Remember your exercises from when we were younger?"
Pulling their hands to each other's chest, she said, "We're going to count with my heart, and you can match it, okay?"

It took the younger woman several minutes to calm down.
They agreed to split the plate of chicken wings, and ate in a comfortable silence.
When the last crumb had been picked off the plates, Nora looked up at her daughter.

"Do you want to talk about it?
Or do you just want to beat me at cards?"
She flicked her head to the already-shuffled deck in the living area.

"I'll talk, but we're going to want to work at the same time.
I need to move my stuff out of my room and into yours."

Nora cocked her head.
"Oh?"

"We're going to have a guest for a while.
She's fourteen, and she just lost her parents in the storm last night."
