I sat there, textbook on my lap but unable to concentrate enough to read.

_What was that?
There's no way it was a dream, right?_

Try as I might, I had trouble coming up with anything specific that I remembered happening before the crash.
It was just another normal flight.
We had hit the turbulence just when the pilot said we would.
Which pilot had it been?
It couldn't have been an hour and a half ago, but that faint-dream-thing made it feel like the full eight hours had passed.

Lawrence.
Lawrence was the name of the pilot.

I'd met him during preflight, before the passengers boarded and before the union rep showed up.
Right.
He'd introduced himself as Lawrence and then introduced his co-pilot, Stephen.
No.
Simon.
That was it.
Lawrence and Simon.
Lawrence I remembered because I'd seen his name tag as he'd approached and I'd thought it was odd that someone would go by Lawrence instead of Larry.
Then he'd spoken, with his erudite enunciation and prince-like politeness, and that mystery had been solved.

_Wait.
You're getting off track._

I was trying to remember specific things that had happened between service and the … incident.
The accident.
Even thinking the words "the explosion" made my jaw clench.

We'd had weather for something like two hours, the kind I think of as checkerboard weather.
We'd hit clear patches, then rough, then clear again, cycling a half dozen times.
It had been enough to warrant the Fasten Seat Belts sign, but not enough to stand out.
I'd been reading for most of it, but I didn't see too many people shifting in their seats.
I was confident that most passengers had slept through it.

Terry had taken the jump seat next to mine.

_He had a book.
What was it?_

I tried to picture it in my mind.
It was a paperback, on the thick side.
White cover.
Red letters, maybe silver?
Maybe silver letters with a red drawing?
Or the reverse?

It wasn't coming to me.
I hadn't paid attention.
My nose had been buried in my textbook in the low light, head focused on working through the homework assignment.
Terry had made one or two attempts to have a conversation, but I couldn't remember any details.
I doubt I had been very good company, as distracted as I'd been.
He'd gone back to his book and I to mine.

After the two-plus hours of weather, we'd had another two and a half of clear air.
Again, I couldn't come up with anything specific that had happened.
Maybe another three or four passengers had gone past me to the lavatories, but I hadn't paid much attention to who or which.

By the time I'd gotten up to stretch at something like six in the morning, Eastern time, nothing at all eventful had happened.

Dreams could be like that, right?
Where you're in one place one moment, then in another place and another time the next moment?
Just a watery blur between the two?

Except that this didn't feel quite like that.
It didn't have that feel of missing time, inasmuch as uninteresting time.

I'd spent the chunk of time, maybe a half hour, getting individual beverages of the non-alcoholic morning variety for passengers as they woke up.
We weren't going to offer a morning beverage service so instead I'd ferried individual and pairs of orange and apple juices, waters, and colas from the galley.
I'm pretty sure I'd even served one or two tomato juices, which I now wondered about given Terry's assertion as to its state.

How had I ended up in the First Class galley with Pamela?

_Towel service._

Right!
That's it!
The memories were coming a little easier now, like I'd dislodged a hairball in a clogged drain.

The man in the business suit had asked for a towel to freshen up.
He hadn't wanted to wait for the now-growing line at the lavatories, so he'd pulled me aside on one of my drink trips and asked if First Class had any left over warm towels.
I'd been embarrassed, as I hadn't remembered if Pamela was going to do a towel service.
HDA only does it for First Class on overnight flights, but not on all of them.
I'm sure there is a pattern to when we do and when we don't, but since I almost never work First Class, I hadn't paid enough attention to spot it.

He'd caught me off guard, so instead of a polite negative I had stammered out an "I'll check".

Terry had been running drinks and collecting trash, like me.
I'd asked him about towel service and he'd said he was almost certain we weren't going to offer it today.
The line for the lavatory was getting to be a problem for getting into and out of the galley, so I'd gotten the passengers into something more orderly and then walked up to First Class to talk to Pamela.

The answer had been obvious from the moment I'd stepped out of Coach—no one in First Class had a towel, and Pamela would have been on top of it—but I was committed and asked her anyway.

That's when the incident had occurred.
I don't even remember if I'd gotten the chance to ask her about the towels.

_That seems awfully vivid for a dream._

Well, the last part was anyway.
The first part, like any other overnighter, was as uneventful and unmemorable as it gets.

Had it been a premonition?
In the movies and on television when fortune tellers and psychics had visions it seemed like they only ever got flashes of the big events.
They got the highlight reel.
Is there such a thing as a mostly-boring premonition?
If there was, that sounds like it would be my luck.
_Sure, I can see the future, but only in real time and only when it's a snooze-fest._
Up until the end, anyway.

Well, if it was a premonition it was already wrong.
From where I'm sitting I can see the dark patch of carpet where I broke the rum bottle, and I can still smell it.
My "premonition" hadn't included a broken bottle.
And I'm not one hundred percent certain, but I think Terry and I ended up switching places during drink service—the premonition had me in front and him behind, but we'd just done the opposite.

At least … I think that's how it happened.
Why hadn't I paid more attention?

_Why would you pay more attention?_

It wasn't like serving bar, where seeing the same customers every night and knowing their favorite drinks would get me more tips.
Sure, I'd seen a few repeat travelers, but not enough times to get to know them.
And since flight attendants don't get tipped it's not like I try to make myself stand out with memorable service.
I pride myself on my professional efficiency and courtesy, not on providing some unforgettable experience.

"May I?"

I'd been so wrapped up in my own head that the voice alone made me jump and almost drop my forgotten textbook.
Pamela was pointing at the jump seat next to me, already moving to sit down without waiting for a response.
I recovered, wrangling my book back into my lap, and nodded.

"How are you doing tonight," I asked, breathless, "everything okay up front?"

Pamela's perfect passenger-facing plastic smile gained the smallest of mirthful smirks and raised eyebrows, her eyes darting to the right to check her periphery for stray eavesdroppers.

"Terry asked to take over for a while.
He wouldn't say why," she paused more for effect than because she expected me to fill in the gap, "but I've seen that look on his face before.
I would hazard to guess he has caught the eye of a lady?"

An undignified snort may or may not have escaped me.
I plead the Fifth.

"Yes, I thought so."

"While I'm thinking about it, question: are you doing a towel service before we land?"

She shook her head, her perfect hair an unmoving testament to patience on a geological scale.
I had a flash memory of walking up the pitched aisle just askance behind her, the wind pulling fly-aways out into a halo a few at a time.
My breath caught at the intensity of the vision.

"No, we didn't load any towels."

I might have been mistaken, but I thought I heard the tiniest hint of acid in her response.
Once again, I'd been too distracted inside my own head to pay attention to someone right in front of me.

_Concentrate!_

She saw something in my expression and tilted her head.

"Why do you ask?"

"I couldn't remember.
It's not important now."

A beat passed, but she spoke again an instant before it would have gotten awkward.

"What's the book?"
