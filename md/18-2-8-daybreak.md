# Daybreak

Terry brought the lights up on schedule while I started up both coffee machines.
Between the lights, activity, and caffeinated aroma, most passengers were already awake by the time Captain Lawrence got on the PA.

"Good morning everyone and welcome to Florida.
We hope you got some good sleep through last night's weather—we did our best to keep it smooth.
We're a half-hour out from Miami International, where the weather is clear and the locals think it's cold at 72 degrees."

That earned him sleepy chuckles which probably woke up a few more passengers.

"The high for today is 80 and we're looking at beautiful sunny weather all day.
We're going to start our descent in about fifteen minutes."

The Coach galley arrival clock read 6:35.

I didn't know the exact time of the first explosion, but it'd been my sole focus for the past two hours.

The guy in the business suit who had asked for a towel had done so as the line for the lavatories had gotten bad.
The line picked up when everyone had heard the announcement Lawrence had just given.
Sure enough, a half-dozen passengers had gotten up and started filing back towards me.

Instead of running coffee and other beverages this time, I left that up to Terry.
I told him I'd make drinks for him while also keeping the lavatory line in order.
He'd looked dubious but hadn't argued.

I wanted to be back in the galley when it happened.
It would give me the best view of events, which I hoped would lead to some sort of clue about what I was supposed to do next.

For every person who left the lavatories and squeezed their way out past the line, another person got out of their seat and kept the queue from shrinking.
Without realizing how much time had passed, I looked up to find the business-suited man in front of me.

"Excuse me, miss," he said in a voice that went from normal volume to a whisper.
"Lily.
I was wondering if you could do me a favor."
He stepped into the galley with me, a tight enough fit when I know the other person.

I knew what he wanted, but I had to let it play out.
It took an act of will to not look at the clocks to mark the time, which might have been misinterpreted by the man.

"How's that, sir?"

"I wanted to wash my face, but I don't want to take up a space in line from someone who really needs it.
Do you think I could get a towel from First Class?"

"I'm sorry, sir, but First Class isn't offering towel service today."

He looked surprised.

"Are you sure?"
His eyes flicked to the front, as if trying to remind me that I could go check.

_That's interesting._
Is he trying to get rid of me?
Does he know something?

I widened my smile and tilted my head.

"Yes, sir."
I put my hand on his shoulder, turning us both back to the aisle.
"But the line is moving quick.
I think you'll be okay to take a moment in the washroom."

He looked like he wanted to say something, but thought better of it and squeezed his way out of the galley to then turn and step back into line.

In loop zero it had taken me a few minutes to finish delivering coffees and collecting trash before I had been able to walk up front.
I continued to organize the now-dwindling line, keeping my eyes on everything around me.
I watched each passenger as they walked into a lavatory, as they exited again, and as they walked past rows 25 through 27, the rows hit hardest in the previous loops.

Nothing interesting happened.

Terry continued to walk the aisle, garbage bag now in hand, collecting used coffee cups.

The father and son in row 27 chatted between yawns.

The businesswoman, now wrapped in her avocado green coat which I had retrieved for her an hour ago, again had her briefcase on her lap and was sorting through its stack of papers.

Suit-and-towel man stepped forward as the line continued to move, looking down at the ground between his feet.

A late-teens young woman in a garish paisley top and jeans was now behind him in line, running a brush through her hair.

Terry waited for enough of the line to clear out before he handed me the garbage bag to stow away.
He stepped into the galley and raised an eyebrow at me.

"Is everything all right?" he asked.
"Still not feeling well?"

I realized that I had a death grip on the edge of the countertop and my eyes were darting all over the place.
I must look like a crazy person.

"Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just been a long flight."

The businesswoman got up and excused herself past the father and son to stand behind the paisley woman.
She smiled at me and said, "too much coffee" with a chuckle.

Minutes passed.
The line cleared out, no one else joining after the businesswoman.
She got her turn in the middle lavatory, but exited a moment after.
She approached us and whispered something into Terry's ear.
He frowned and nodded, heading back to check it.
The suited man walked back to his seat somewhere around 20 on the port side, allowing the business woman to take his lavatory closest to the exit door.
The young woman in paisley exited and returned to her seat in the Smoking section.

Terry stepped back out of the middle door and beckoned me over.
I could smell the problem as I stepped closer.
The sticky-sweet odor of marijuana drifted out of the door.

"Great," I said to him.

"Someone disabled the smoke detector.
I want to see if I can get it working again, but we'll lock the door anyway.
Can you grab the key?"

We kept a door key in the storage closet with the cleaning supplies.
It wasn't meant to lock anyone in, but instead to lock everyone out.
As I fetched and handed it over to Terry, a _ding!_ sounded over the PA accompanied by Simon's voice.

"We are beginning our descent into Miami.
Please return to your seats at this time and extinguish all smoking materials.
Flight attendants prepare for landing."

Terry looked up at the smoke detector then back down at me.

"They'll have to fix it on the ground."
He stepped out of the doorway and used the key to lock the door behind him.

The businesswoman stepped out of the far lavatory and saw us both standing there.

"I am so sorry, I'll get right to my seat."

"Thank you," Terry said and followed her past me.
He split off at the galley and grabbed the PA mic.

"Ladies and gentlemen I'll need you to please put up your tray tables and bring your seats to a full upright position.
Please put out any cigarettes.
Make sure your safety belts are securely fastened.
We'll be on the ground shortly."

He hung up the mic and turned back to me.

"I'll take Smoking, you take Non?"

"Sounds good."

We both moved forward into the aisle, Terry at a brisk walk and me more slowly, looking down each aisle and checking for belts and trays.
Approaching passengers from the rear this time, we'd be able to catch people trying to get away with their tray tables down or their belts unfastened.

Yes, I promise you we do know when you're doing it on purpose.

The businesswoman was still getting into her seat, trying to wedge that oversized briefcase under the seat in front of her.

"Seatbelts please," I said in her direction.

"Yes, just a moment," she said without looking up.
I moved forward, knowing I could check her again on my way back.

I made it to row 20 before the explosion went off.

The floor jumped under me and I fell.
I bounced off the back of 19C and landed hard on my elbows.
My ears popped while also ringing.
I could hear people screaming, but it sounded wrong and far away, mixing in with the howl of the wind.

What did I miss?

It happened again!
And for no reason that I could see.
My thoughts sloshed around in my brain like runny tapioca pudding.
I couldn't get them organized.

Pamela's voice rang out over the PA.
"OXYGEN MASKS!
PUT ON YOUR MASK BEFORE HELPING THOSE AROUND YOU!
REMAIN CALM."

I pulled myself to my feet, some part of me horrified to feel the now-too-familiar cant to the deck.
I turned to see exactly what I knew I was going to see.

Row 27 was gone.
The woman in her bright green coat that clashed with her dark red blouse.
The father and son who had just been talking about their plans to drive down to Key West.
The coat closet was gone, only some loose flaps of metal and fabric hanging where it had connected to the ceiling.

The three women in 26A through C were screaming, gripping the backs of the seats in front of them.

I waited for the drumming in my head to start, but it didn't.
My ears were ringing, my lungs were burning, my elbows felt banged up, and I could still feel that wobbly headache, but the pain before the loop reset wasn't happening.
My fingertips weren't going numb.

I shook it off and lurched uphill along the aisle, heading aft.
The oxygen bottles and masks I needed were in the storage closet.
I didn't want to go anywhere near that gaping maw of twisted metal, but I did want to be able to breathe.

Pamela's voice continued, authoritative over the PA.

"ASSUME CRASH POSITIONS.
BEND FORWARD AND PUT YOUR HEAD ON YOUR KNEES.
CUP YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD."

I felt a hand on my shoulder and looked to see Terry behind me.
He had a nasty gash from his temple to his chin.
I could see his pulse in the blood as it seeped out of the wound, ran down his face, and dripped off his chin.
The rest of his face was white and had a sheen of perspiration.

"Terry!" I screamed.
"Come on!"

I got a shoulder under him and we made it back to the galley.
I leaned him against the counter and grabbed for the storage closet door.
It was jammed, but a few kicks and yanks got it open.

I grabbed two of the three dark green bottles from their shelf, along with the bright yellow masks tethered to them.
I unraveled one, got the mask strap over my face, and got a blast of that stale metallic smell as I twisted the knob open wide.
I did the same for Terry, though I had him hold his mask so I wouldn't have to drag elastic across that wound.

The tail bucked beneath us, whipping Terry's head around.
He didn't catch himself fast enough and his head slammed into a cupboard.
He blinked at me, dazed.

"Come on," I yelled over the wind, pointing at the jump seats.
"You need to get strapped in!"

I got my shoulder under him again, though he felt heavier and more sluggish this time.
We walked along the wall to the jump seats.
I unlatched one, kicking it with my heel.
It sprang open and my textbook flopped out onto the floor.
I kicked it aside.

I got Terry into the seat, though it was more of a controlled fall than a gentle operation.
His eyes rolled back in his head and the hand holding the mask dropped to his chest.

"Nope!
Come on, Terry!
Terry!"

I didn't want to hurt him any more than he was, but I had no choice.
I grabbed the mask out of his hand and jammed the elastic over his head, snapping it into place.
In a moment of inspiration, I flung open the door of the lavatory next to us and squatted to dig in the cupboard under the sink.
I pulled away the box of tissues that fit there, ripping open its cardboard and extracting the entire stack of paper.

I moved back to Terry, stretched wide the elastic of his mask, and jammed the tissues between it and his face, positioning them along the wound.
I pulled the elastic tight and he flinched, though he was still too dazed to put up a fight.
I hoped the tissues would help staunch the blood, but I wasn't sure.

I pulled myself along the wall back to the galley and looked ahead at the passengers.
Pamela's voice had stopped and I could see her walking back along the aisle toward me, pausing to push down people into crash positions.

I looked at the arrival clock: 6:58.

_Why am I not looping?
Did it take this long before?_

The sight of Pamela struggling toward me shook me out of it.
I moved to mirror her, pushing passengers into crash positions as I went.

"That's everyone," I yelled to her over the wind as we met.

She looked over my shoulder at the hole in the airframe.
Her face fell and I followed her gaze.
The pre-dawn lights of some city were passing beneath us, but they were wrong: they were sliding left to right instead of receding into the distance.
The view was hypnotic in its impossibility.
I wanted to stare at it to understand how such a thing could happen.
I lost several seconds to it before a dark shape interrupted my view and I came back to myself.

Pamela was still entranced.
I pulled her close to me and spoke into her ear.
"We're spinning.
We need to get strapped in."

She nodded and looked toward the rear.

"We can't—I've got Terry strapped in back there."
I didn't have to spell out the rest for her, that each jump seat station only had room for two.
I wanted to go back and strap in next to Terry and make sure he was okay.
Another part of me wanted to be as far away from that hole as I could get.
That second voice won as Pamela and I moved as fast as we could back toward the cockpit.

As we stepped into First Class our world turned sideways.
A loud crack and shriek of metal was accompanied by a shudder and the floor rolled out from under us.
The passengers started screaming again as their carry-ons rained down on them from the shelves over their heads.

Pamela fell into the arm rest of a seat and I fell on top of her, all while we continued to rotate.
I rolled past her, over the heads of the passengers, and slammed into the starboard carry-on shelf, bags from the port shelf now falling on me as we passed ninety degrees.
I threw a purse away from my face to see Pamela scrambling above me, desperate to gain purchase as we were almost upside down.
She lost her grip, falling into the ceiling next to me.

Her cheek struck a light fixture and her neck snapped to the side with an audible crack.
I clung to the shelf, seeing her go limp and slide down toward the cockpit.
I found myself screaming her name uncontrollably.

It started in my fingers again, followed by the drumbeat of my pulse.
My grip on the shelf weakened and failed, despite my best efforts.
I slid out of the shelf and dropped to a spot in the roof near the shelf on the other side.
I tried to get my arms up in front of me, but they were already numb to the elbow and flopped uselessly at my sides.
I hit the shelf hard with my shoulder and my vision tunneled.
There was a moment of pain before the shoulder went numb.

My headache intensified until I thought my head would split.

_Hang on just a few more seconds._

Even though debris continued to fall into me it felt far away.
I couldn't hear anything over the kettle drums in my head.

_Just hang—_
