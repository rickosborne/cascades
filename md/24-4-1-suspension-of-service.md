# Suspension of Service

I felt the reset happen and was ready for it.
I snapped back to the drink cart with only a gasp and a slight buckling of the knees.
I felt like I had stuck the landing, but Terry noticed.

"Everything all right?"

The headache and hunger kicked in.
I could feel my heart ratchet up from calm.
I put a finger across my lips and threw my eyes at the passengers.

"I'm thinking," I said as I stepped backward to put my back against the storage closet door, "that I probably overstocked the rum."

I opened the coat closet door as quietly as I could, continuing to talk as I flipped through the hanging clothes.

"We should swap it out for vodka so it doesn't keep everyone awake."

Terry stared at me, unmoving.
I found the coat I was looking for: avocado green cashmere.
I pulled it free and slid the door shut, hooking a finger at Terry to follow me down the aisle to the jump seats.
I tapped the drink cart brakes free and slid it to block the aisle before relocking it.

Terry looked mystified, whispering "What is going on?"

"I think Irene Peters in 27A has a bomb."

"What?" he yelled, then covered his mouth.

I looked at him with eyes wide, trying to underline how critical it was that he be quiet.

"I don't know why she's doing it, but she has a parachute sewn into her coat.
Feel how heavy it is," I said, holding out the coat to him.
I'd noticed its heft before, but I can't believe I'd ignored it.

Terry looked skeptical, then lifted the coat by the collar.
"So it's got a winter lining.
So what?"

"Let's see," I said as I started to search around the edges of the rough nylon interior.
Nothing was apparent, which frustrated me.
I know what I saw.

"Wait—" Terry started to say.

A growl escaped my lips.
I grabbed the nylon in one hand and the cashmere in the other and yanked as hard as I could.
A seam gave way, easier than I was expecting, ripping apart the fabrics from collar to hem in a single motion.
A stream of black nylon poured out onto the floor from between the two layers.

Terry gasped.
"How did you know?"

I couldn't come up with an answer that would make any sense, so I ignored the question.
"We need to tell the cockpit."

Terry's eyes were wide, locked on the pile of cloth at our feet.

"Terry!" I hissed at him.
He turned his head to look at me, but his mind was stuck on the parachute, his eyes unseeing.
I grabbed his shoulders and stared at him.
"Come on, Terry!"

A flash of insight hit and I turned to open a lavatory.
I scooped up the nylon, shoveling it a hunk at a time through the doorway.
There was far more fabric than should have been possible.
Terry stood there, shaking his head.

"We need to lock this," I said, crossing to the storage closet to get the key.
The aisle was clear, but a few passengers were turned to look back in our direction.
I locked the door, putting the key in my pocket instead of returning it to the closet.

I grabbed the PA mic and toggled it active.

"Ladies and gentlemen, we're having some trouble with the wheels on the beverage cart.
It's blocking the aisle back here, so please remain in your seats for now.
Give us just a few more minutes and we'll get it straightened out."

That seemed to appease a few passengers, though not all.

I hung up the PA mic and pulled the telephone handset off the wall, punching the button to ring the First Class galley.
Pamela picked up after several seconds, as Terry shuffled into the galley next to me.

"First Class," she answered.

"We have a sandstorm.
I'm coming up."

The line was silent for a beat before Pamela responded with "Acknowledged" and hung up.

Terry was alert, back to normal.

"Stay here," I told him.
"Don't let anyone back here.
If she gets up, don't confront her.
She doesn't know we're onto her."

"Right," he said, nodding.

I hustled it up to the cockpit, grabbing Pamela as I went.
We squeezed in behind the vacant Navigator's seat and closed the door behind us.
Lawrence and Simon rotated in their seats to look at us.
I couldn't think of a way to sugarcoat it, so I blurted it out.

"A passenger has brought a bomb on board."

Pamela gasped and covered her mouth.
Lawrence and Simon looked at each other but didn't say anything.

"Irene Peters in 27A," I continued, "is planning to detonate her bomb somewhere between Texas and Florida."

Lawrence spoke first.
"How do you know this?"

This is my fourth loop.
Since I figured out there was a bomb, I've known that this conversation would have to happen sooner or later.
I've had hours to work through my story.

"It's why I was pulled away during boarding," I lied, "and why we were delayed for ninety minutes.
I was being briefed on the situation."

"Why you?" asked Simon?

I'd anticipated this question, but hadn't been able to come up with a believable answer.
"I can't tell you that, sorry.
You're not cleared."

The pilots shared another look.
Pamela stared at me like she'd never seen me before.

"We need to divert," said Lawrence, turning back to his instruments and reaching toward a panel marked RADIO.

"Wait," I commanded, "stop.
It's not that simple."

"Why not?" asked Lawrence, facing me but keeping his hand an inch from the panel.

"She's smart and she has a detonator.
If she knows we're diverting, I don't know what she'll do.
And if you call this in the guys on the ground are going to try to tell us what to do.
They don't have all the details, so we can't let that happen until we're ready."

Lawrence didn't like this at all.
"What exactly do you expect us to do?"

"We need to subdue her so she can't detonate the bomb.
And I think it needs to be just the cabin crew—if she sees you two back there she may figure out that something is happening."

Lawrence liked this even less.

"You two need to be up here.
I was told that if she detonates where she's seated, it could cause the aircraft to spin."
I flattened my right hand out in front of all of us, rotating it to the left and sliding it through space.
"If that happens, it will take both of you to recover."

I figured if I was going to do this, I was going to go all the way.
I broke away from my script.

"And it's even more complicated than that."
I held up my hands in a placating gesture.
"We need to do it without any of the other passengers knowing.
We can't start a scene."

"What?" Lawrence started to get angry.

"Mary Hamilton in 18E has a life-threatening heart condition.
If there's a panic, she's likely to have an arrest."

Simon swore under his breath, while Pamela gasped and covered her mouth again.

Lawrence stared at me, the muscles in his jaw tight.
He spoke through his teeth.

"What's your plan?"
