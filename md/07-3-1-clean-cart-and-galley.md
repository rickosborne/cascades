# Galley Duty

I choked back a laugh and had an idea.
I grabbed for the PA microphone.

"Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to dim the lights for the evening.
Terry is going to make one more pass through the cabin to pick up any leftover service items.
This will also be your last chance for the restroom before we hit some bumpy weather in 20 minutes.
Try to get a good night's sleep and we'll see you in Florida."

Only two passengers made their way back to the lavatories.
Everyone else was either content or already asleep.

I scrubbed my hands in the tiny galley sinkâ€”no matter how careful I was, I always felt like I ended up with my hands covered in beverage after service.
I looked around for stray items, but we'd cleaned up well.
Nothing was going to rattle around when the weather hit.
I managed to waste another ten minutes before giving up and going back to my jump seat.
