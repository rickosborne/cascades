# Pageant Pamela

I should mention that I've flown with Pamela twice before.
I don't think either was a long flight, and she's always in First Class and both times I'd been in Coach as I am now, so we didn't get much opportunity to chat and get to know each other.
There's a reason I've always seen her work First Class, and for once it has nothing to do with seniority.

In my mind, Pamela's full name is Pageant Pamela.
I don't think I even know her last name, though I admit I must have seen it on a manifest at some point.
It doesn't matter, because her real last name is immaterial.
Pageant Pamela.
That's who she is, and anyone who met her would come to the same conclusion.

To be clear, I name her this out of respect, awe, appreciation, and no small amount of jealousy.

Pamela is as close to the flight attendant definition of beauty and perfection as you're going to get.
As part of my degree program I took a course in computational statistics.
I am therefore qualified to tell you that she's a standard deviation or three to the far end of the curve.
Even if you make a sample group containing only flight attendants, she's still off the scale.

She's six feet even in heels, and I suspect an impressive five-eleven in flats.
She fills out her uniform just enough to catch every man's eye, but carries herself with so much elegance that it wouldn't occur to them to mentally remove said uniform.
Her skin has the perfect, tight smoothness of someone my age in her mid-to-late twenties, but speaks with an authority and assuredness that I associate with someone a decade or two older than me.

What kills me is that she makes it seem so _effortless_.

The beauty standards the airlines hold us to are contested and recently illegal, but you can't change decades of historical inertia overnight.
We are, for all intents and purposes, an entire industry built on beauty standards and professionalism.
This means we all know we are, as a rule, better looking than average.
Some of us can get wrapped up in that and turn it into an end instead of a means.

When I say Pamela made it look effortless what I mean is that I'd never seen her primp, flirt, or do anything to suggest that her beauty was anything other than a remarkable coincidence.

I, on the other hand … where to begin?

Look, I know I'm not bad on the eyes, but nor am I even in the same league as Pamela.

When I'm not hunched over a book I hit a respectable five-seven in my work heels.
I don't fill out my uniform in the same statuesque proportions—I feel like I have weak, round shoulders and my waist doesn't hourglass inwards inasmuch as drop straight down from bust to hips.
The straight black hair I got from my father, or so I'm told, is thick and straight enough that I can do a very professional braid or bun that will stay under control for all but the longest of flights without giving me a driving headache.

If I'm honest, I know I'm to the left side of the mean on the flight attendant curve.
I didn't get the job because I'm the fairest of them all.
I got it because I've worked enough service industry jobs to know how to handle myself, and given enough time in front of a mirror I can get myself just about to that middle line.
I won't be able to do so forever, but I can hold out for a few more years.
