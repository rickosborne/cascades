# London, September 7, 1940

## Black Saturday: first day of The Blitz

Nora, as she had grown used to the English calling her, looked into the eyes of the woman she had raised.
While the twenty-two years between them had grown her daughter into a strong force of will to be reckoned with, the look she saw now reminded her of the scared four-year-old she'd first met.
Eyes wide, chest heaving, her breath came in the same gasps as all those years ago.

Nora pressed down against her daughter's fingers, held tight in her own hands.
She spoke in slow, measured words, using the calmest tone she could manage, under the conditions.
She even pronounced her words in the slow, clear English she would use with guests, instead of the usual mishmash of low English and Evenki the two used when alone together.

"Mary.
Listen to my voice and stay with me.
You're here with me.
We're together."

Ripping open her own collar, she pressed her daughter's hand to her chest, holding it there.
The tiny fingers felt so cold and fragile against her own too-warm skin.

"Feel my heart.
I need you to count it with me, okay?
Can you—"

A teeth-rattling boom reverberated through the house, interrupting her.
Plaster shook free from the ceiling and walls, making them each cough.
Mary clenched against her.
She wanted to shout, but kept her voice to a low whisper.

"Come on, Mary, stay with me, please.
We're going to count out my heart, so you can match it with yours.
Okay?
You start when you're ready."

Mary gave the barest hint of a nod before shaking her head, struggling to clear it.

Keeping their hands pressed to Nora's chest, she put her other hand on the back of her daughter's neck, drawing their foreheads together.
She massaged gently, trying to work out the tension there.

The first number came out as the tiniest exhalation: "One."

Nora matched the breath out with her own, finishing the triplet.
"Two, three."
She didn't think Mary was going to keep time, but another soft syllable escaped the younger woman's lips.

"Two."

"Two, three."

Mary finally inhaled.
"Three."

"Two, three."

They counted out the steps to their dance, until Mary got to ten.
Nora moved to match her free hand to mirror the pair against her chest, this time to her daughter's.

They made it to thirty-five triplets before a reverberating boom shook the house, kicking up another cloud of plaster.
Mary flinched less this time, moving her own free hand on top of her mother's.

"I—I'm here.
I'm here."
Each word gained a little more life and volume.

Nora could feel Mary's heart, a strong kick even through the fabric of her top.
It had slowed considerably, but was still going twice as fast as her own.

"I'm glad.
We're going to be alright.
In fact, if you can get this a little more under control," she tapped a finger against her daughter's chest, "I have some good news for you."

Mary nodded, replying not with words but with slower breaths.
Distant booms echoed as the minutes passed, but the young woman was less and less affected by them.

"Actually," Nora continued, "I have two pieces of good news for you."

Mary nodded for her mother to continue.

"First, that was as close as they will get to us tonight.
The worst is over, and you made it through in one piece."

Mary kept her eyes closed and her breathing regular, but the corner of her mouth curled into a tentative smile.
She gave another nod.

"Second, you're going to get what you've been begging for the past five years."

Mary's eyes shot open, and with their hands still against each other's chests, Nora could feel her daughter's heart pick back up in anticipation.

Nora bobbed her head in the affirmative.
"Yes.
I've packed," she pointed to the canvas bags against the far wall, now covered in a layer of grey-white dust, "and I have all our money and papers."
She flicked her head to a pair of zippered leather folios on the bookshelf next to the bags.

Looking at the prepared items, the color again drained from Mary's face.
She looked at her mother, her voice hitching as she spoke.
"Did—Did you?
How—How many times?"

Nora tried to keep her jaw from clenching, but she knew the smart and observant woman in front of her would catch it, no matter how distracted she was.

"Not too many.
Don't worry about it."
The older woman brought all four hands together between them.
"We always find the path, don't we?"

Mary narrowed her eyes at her mother.
"Is it over five?  Six?
Promise me you're safe."

Nora thought about lying, but decided against it.
"This is six.
Our path is ... complicated by what you will see outside."

Mary looked ready to say more, but shook her head.
Drawing her mother into a tight hug, she whispered between them.
"I love you and I trust you."
Pulling apart, she asked, "What do I need to know?"

Nora took a deep breath, then brought them both to their feet.

"We'll both need to change into trousers.
I'll explain as we do."
