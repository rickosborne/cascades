# Beverage Service

I made sure to take the front of the drink cart this time.
I wanted to talk to Mr. Dearborn and Mrs. Hamilton in 18.

It was a weird experience, serving from the front of the cart for the second time.
I hadn't been paying much attention the first time, so I didn't have the orders memorized, but some of them were â€¦ just there.
Like a half-remembered exchange of dialogue from a favorite movie or book.
You don't quite have it until someone starts saying it, then the words line up and tumble out after each other.

I didn't know how it would possibly help, but I paid complete attention this time through.
As I stepped from each row to the next I recited the orders from the previous row to solidify them in my memory.
Then I tried to dig up a memory of the orders of the next row.

I also tried to keep an ear out for what Terry's passengers were ordering and how they were interacting.
That was harder to keep in my head at the same time, but I found the challenge invigorating.
I felt like a spy on a secret mission, gathering intelligence.

We finished with the Smoking section.
I pulled the translucent curtains shut behind me.
A number of passengers lit up as soon as they got their drinks, so the smoke was becoming palpable.
The air filters would catch up, but these first few minutes of beverage service were always like this.

I served 18A, B, and C, then turned to my left, holding out a drink napkin.

"What can I offer you this evening?"

The severe-looking redhead in the window seat, Ms. Keats, shot a glance at Mr. Dearborn.
He returned a slight shrug.
Mrs. Hamilton seemed to have missed the exchange, looking up at me and shaking her head.
I studied what little I could see of her but didn't come away with anything more than I had before: she didn't look sick inasmuch as she just looked frail to a degree I'd never seen.

I'd visited my great-grandfather once when I was six or seven.
He'd been living in one of those retirement communities that was an apartment complex crossed with a hospital.
Orderlies pushed around wheelchairs that contained women who looked less frail than Mrs. Hamilton.

"Can't," was all she said, a hand poking out from under her blankets to tap on her chest, indicating her heart.

"May I at least offer you some more water?"
I pointed to the empty cup on the tray in front of her.

The elderly woman considered it, but then shook her head again.

"Thank you, though."

"Of course.
And for you?"
I looked at Ms. Keats.
I had a flash and remembered that Terry had said her name was Jennifer.

"I'd kill for a beer," she said with a voice that was huskier than I'd expected.
I couldn't remember if she'd said anything the first time through.
Her accent was generic middle American, though her cadence had something of a practical, blue collar feel.
It was something of a mismatch with her clothes, a paisley silk shirt and maroon blazer combination, but it's not uncommon for people to dress up a bit for a flight.
This isn't the fifties, so people aren't going to put on their Sunday finest to fly, but no one wants to spend eight hours in an enclosed space feeling judged for their outfit.

I held up a silver can of beer, cheap of course, for her inspection.

"That's it?"

"I'm afraid so, though I can also offer a limited selection of mixed drinks."

Jennifer's mouth curled down in disappointment.
Her pale-skinned face tightened, stretching and creasing the innumerable freckles she didn't even try to hide with makeup.
It would have been a lost cause to try.
There wasn't a square centimeter of her face, from her hairline to the tight cords of her neck that fell into the ruffles of her shirt, that wasn't covered in small brown dots.

"Figures.
No, that will be fine."

I peeled the tab off the can, dropping it with a clink into the small garbage can on the cart.
The smell of salty hops tickled the inside of my nose.
I filled a plastic cup, replacing the now-half-full can on the cart beside the rest.

She accepted the cup and took a sip.
Her eyes fluttered closed as she inhaled through her nose.
The beer wasn't anything to write home about, so she must not have had one in a long time.
I saw myself drop out of her awareness as she leaned back against her seat.
My focus shifted to Dearborn.

"And for you, sir?
We're having a run on Bloody Marys, if you are so inclined?"

For all of Jennifer's striking traits, Dearborn's were that much more average.
Thinning black hair shot through with a fair amount of grey, not shaggy our unkempt, but not styled.
Thick-rimmed glasses that were simple and functional, without being cheap.
Dark eyes that may have been brown or black, it was impossible to tell in this light.
A black suit that didn't have the flared collar or busy patterns that were in right now, but would probably still be wearable in five or even ten years.

I tried to think of a more interesting word than "average" to describe him, but came up blank.

Dearborn considered the offer of a Bloody Mary, glancing aside to Mrs. Hamilton, whose eyes were already closed, her head reclined against the seat.

"Sure.
A Bloody Mary sounds great."

I started to mix it, talking as I worked.
Between bartending and this job, I'd mixed enough drinks to be able to keep my smile and eye contact with him as I did so.
His smile up at me was also average: neither lewd nor disinterested.

"The mix is pretty mild."
I held up and waggled a small red bottle.
"Care for an extra kick?"

He waved off the suggestion.

"I'm a lightweight, but thanks."
He took the plastic cup I offered him and set it on his tray, looking back at me.

I didn't know what I was looking for, but I wasn't ready to move to the next row quite yet.
Thinking fast, I held up the pitcher of ice water to the man.
I didn't say anything but pointed at the empty cup in front of Mrs. Hamilton and cocked my head at him, questioning.

Again he considered it before answering.

"You know what, Alex?
I could use some water to go with this."
He pointed at the cup I'd just given him.
"May I?"

"Of course, sir."

I grabbed another cup and poured out a serving.
He accepted it, replaced the cup on Mrs. Hamilton's tray, and gave me the empty with a "we'll see" shrug and a spoken "thanks".

I leaned down to whisper to him.

"We're going to have some turbulence later.
Could you make sure she's buckled in before she falls asleep?"

Mr. Dearborn gave a vigorous nod, continuing to look at me as if my presence demanded his attention.
I found myself out of stalling tactics, so I smiled and stepped forward to 19.
