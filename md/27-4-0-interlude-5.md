# Miami, Summer 1963

An electric hum of medical equipment permeated the hospital room.
Mary and Jen sat on opposite sides of the bed, each holding one of Nora's loose hands.
While both were cried out hours ago, their eyes were still bloodshot.

Jen's question came out as a raspy whisper.
She kept her eyes on the rise and fall of Nora's chest as she spoke.
"Are you sure we're doing the right thing?"

Mary's response was pained and heavy.
"Of course I'm not.
But I couldn't do this a second time.
Could you?"

Jen didn't have to think before answering.
"No.
Absolutely not."

The end came within the hour, as the doctors had warned.
They'd spoken of massive heart damage from a "cardiac event", and while both women understood every word, each also knew that was only one side of the truth.

The drive later, with just the two women, was quiet until Jen turned the car off US-1.
She pulled them into a small parking lot with a wooden ramp down to the beach.

"Are we walking on the sand?" Mary asked.
"I don't really have the shoes for it, I'm sorry to say."

"No, we can just roll down the windows and listen.
If you don't mind."

Other cars came and went, people walked up and down the ramp, and the better part of another hour passed in silence.

"I got the job."
Jen spoke as if replying to a question.
"I'm going to take it."

Mary's reply was cautious.
"Which one?"

The younger woman worked her jaw.
"Assistant.
I couldn't land the Operator job, or Engineer.
Not enough experience for either, they said."

Mary put her hand on top of the fist balled in Jen's lap.
"I'm so sorry."

The tension kept Jen's neck wound in a solid braid of taut muscles. 
"Nine times.
I did the interviews nine times.
But it didn't matter.
No matter what I said, they didn't care about my degrees, or my grades, or my thesis or papers."

Her breath hitched, as if leading into a sob, but she sneered it down.
Jamming the lighter into the dashboard, she snatched at the pack of cigarettes just below it.
It was empty, so she crumpled it and threw it into her purse, pulling out and opening a new pack.

"By the eighth, I knew it was a lost cause.
I could barely hear their questions over the pounding in my head, much less keep it all straight.
I don't think I even remember the ninth.
I held it together long enough to get back out to my car before I passed out."

Grabbing the lighter as it popped out, Jen freed herself from the car and leaned against it.
On the other side, Mary did the same, walking around to the back where she wouldn't be downwind.
Their movements had the practiced familiarity of a dance often repeated.
The sea breeze pulled strands from their matching braids.

Jen took a long drag before ducking back in through the open window to replace the lighter.
Shrugging, she continued.

"But it's NASA.
It's space.
Maybe, once I'm inside, I can show them ... me.
I don't know."
Another long, slow drag followed by a flick of ask and a jet of smoke across the hood of the car.
"Is that dumb?
Am I being dumb?"

The older woman paused before answering.

"Smoking is dumb."
She pointed at Jen's cigarette, earning an eye-roll.
"Going nine times is dumb."
Her finger looped in the air, then traced a path between Jen's temple and her own.
"But, you've been talking about rockets as long as I've known you.
Chasing after a dream is never dumb."

Jen sighed, throwing the half-finished cigarette to the ground and stamping it out.
"You would not believe the migraine I had the next day.
I will never do that again."

Mary walked to put an arm around the young woman, leaning them both against the sun-warmed car.
Jen looked at her, before ducking her head.

"And we're not going to talk to the looks I got at the hotel restaurant when I polished off my third plate."
She rested her cheek on the older woman's shoulder, sighing.

Mary knew the next question alreadyâ€”not because she'd heard it before, but because it was written all over the contours behind the younger woman's freckles.
She waited in a comfortable silence until Jen was ready to ask it.

"Could ... could you come with me?"
