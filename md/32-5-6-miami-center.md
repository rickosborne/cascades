# Miami Center

I told Ernest to clean himself up in the First Class lavatory, then to get back to his seat.

"You're going to want to hear this," I crooked a finger at Pam, then walked to the cockpit door and knocked.
"It's Alex and Pamela," I announced.

The door opened with a click.
Simon had us lock the door behind ourselves as we entered.

"I know what's going on.
It's espionage," I told them all.
"We're in the middle of a James Bond movie."

Simon, as usual, did not like what I had to say.
"Some Bond girl, I am."

Not rising to his challenge, I ignored him.

"Irene Peters, the bomber, is attempting to—"

"Wait," waved Lawrence.
He leaned over and flicked a switch marked `SPKR` on the `RADIO` panel, then turned in his seat to face us.
"Pick up that mic," he said, pointing to one attached to the empty second officer's console.

I did so and handed it to him.
Lawrence depressed the button and spoke.

"Miami Center, Roadrunner 238.
We have those details."

A scratchy, distorted voice came out of several speakers.
Lawrence handed me back the mic.

"Roadrunner 238, go ahead."

"How much do they know?" I asked before keying the mic.

"Everything you told us before."

My throat went dry.
I wished I'd kept a cup of water for myself.
I held down the button.

"Irene Peters, the bomber in 27A, is attempting to steal some kind of secret files brought on board by the man in 18D.
That man, Ernest Dearborn, claims to work for NASA.
He says the files are actually the property of Mary Hamilton in 18E.
He was stealing her files, and drugging her to make it seem like she was getting old and batty."

"So?" interrupted Simon.
"Who cares?"

I continued to ignore him.

"Mary Hamilton died in her sleep, in 18E, earlier this evening."

Pamela's hand went to her mouth.

"Jesus, that's awful," Simon said, deflated.
Lawrence shot Simon a look that caused him to turn and face forward.

I put one hand on Pamela's shoulder to steady her, then pulled the other out of my apron.
In it was the silver tube.

"The bomb has a pressure switch that will go off after we start to descend.
I have the remote detonator."

The aircraft pitched as Simon, hands on the yoke, jumped in his seat.
Pamela choked and coughed.
Lawrence went pale.

"I got it out of Irene's purse after I drugged her."

"You—" Simon stammered, not looking back, "You can't be serious."

I let the mic go dead as I unscrewed the cap and showed everyone the white button, carefully replacing it.

Lawrence held out his hand.
"I'll take that."

I retracted my hands and put them back into my apron pocket.
"Sorry, but no.
It's leverage."

"Miami, I don't suppose you've figured out a way to get us into the rear luggage compartment?"

"238, that's a negative, but I have some very smart people working on it here.
Please say your fuel status."

Lawrence replied using his own headset this time.

"Miami, 238 needs to be on approach within the next eight-zero minutes."

"Acknowledged, 238, within the next eight-zero minutes.
Squawk seven-seven-zero-zero."

Lawrence reached down and dialed `7700` into one of his consoles.

"238, squawk 7700.
Will advise of further developments and would appreciate if you'd keep us in mind."

"238, we certainly will.
Miami out."

"Hey," I said to Lawrence, "who's your favorite football team?"
