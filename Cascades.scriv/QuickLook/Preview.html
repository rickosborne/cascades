<p class="binderItem"><strong>1: Cruising Altitude</strong><br/>The speaker crackled and my ears perked up, the response Pavlovian—uncontrollable.<br/>
“Ladies and gentlemen we have reached cruising altitude.”<br/>
My eyes stared at the public address speaker on the wall ahead of me while my hands pulled my bookmark from the back of my book and slid it into place on the current page.<br/>
“I’m turning off the No Smoking sign in the forward cabin,” the ding! chimed over the PA in the same cadence as the man’s speech, as if it was just another piece of punctuation in his sen...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>2: Lily</strong><br/>I should have introduced myself.  Sorry about that.  My head was wrapped up in homework, and then service, and well, you know how it goes.  For someone who is paid to have good manners, I’m not as good at it as I ought to be.<br/>
My name is Lily.  Liliana Theresa Ramirez Alonso, but no one calls me Liliana who isn’t reading my name off a clipboard.<br/>
I’ve been a flight attendant for High Desert Airlines since April, flying since May, for just about six months now.  I admit I’m having a small identity ...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>3: After Service</strong><br/>Service was a 40-minute blur.  I checked out somewhere around the third passenger.  When you’re used to being behind a bar keeping a half-dozen orders of far more complex drinks, taking and then serving three at a time requires less brainpower than it does patience.<br/>
We stowed the cart and did one last pass through the cabin before Terry got on the PA.<br/>
“Lily’s coming through the cabin now to collect any leftover service items.  We’re going to dim the lights so everyone can get some sleep.  We’re ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>4: Reserve</strong><br/>I should explain reserve.  I’m not doing a very good job at narrating, sorry.<br/>
I’m what we call “reserve crew”.  Most crew fly the same lines, sequences of flights that usually start and end at the same place so that the crew can feel like they have some semblance of a place to call home.  Good lines are jealously coveted, and are doled out based on your seniority.  Since I’ve only been in the air for six months, I have almost no chance of getting even a decent line.<br/>
Instead, I fly reserve, which...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>5: Descent</strong><br/>I was in the First Class galley when the tail of the plane exploded.<br/>
You don’t have to see something like that happen to know that it did.  When there’s a sudden loud booming noise that reverb-fades into a howling wind just before your ears pop and you find that you can’t breathe too-cold air, well, what else could have happened?<br/>
The ground fell away from my feet and the bulkhead rushed sideways to meet my face.  I got my arms up in time, but I feel something snap in my right forearm before it s...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>6: Awake</strong><br/>“Lily.”<br/>
Oh, hey, that’s me.<br/>
“Lily.”<br/>
Why was someone saying my name?  And saying it wrong.<br/>
“Talk to me, girl.”  Except it was gihl.  Terry?<br/>
I struggled to open my eyes.  A brown haze of a perm surrounded an indistinct face that was tanned to only a few shades lighter.  Terry.<br/>
The synchronized drumbeats in my head and chest began to slow and my senses came back one at a time.<br/>
Hearing: Where was the wind?  It’s so quiet now.<br/>
Smell: Cheap rum.<br/>
Sight: Terry’s face couldn’t have been more than a few i...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>7: Weather</strong><br/>I could feel the gentle bank to port just as I stowed the last of the leftover drinks.  I added two miniature bottles of gin by pushing back a half-dozen bottles of rum, which I’d run back from the cart on an earlier trip to the galley when it had become clear we were going to need far more vodka.  Terry had been a Bloody Mary salesman, convincing passengers that the sugar in the rum would keep them up and that the tomato juice was as close as they’d come to dinner service for the evening.  Betw...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>8: Pageant Pamela</strong><br/>I should mention that I’ve flown with Pamela twice before.  I don’t think either was a long flight, and she’s always in First Class and both times I’d been in Coach as I am now, so we didn’t get much opportunity to chat and get to know each other.  There’s a reason I’ve always seen her work First Class, and for once it has nothing to do with seniority.<br/>
In my mind, Pamela’s full name is Pageant Pamela.  I don’t think I even know her last name, though I admit I must have seen it on a manifest at s...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>9: Authoritative</strong><br/>“It’s a textbook.”  I flipped it up so she could read the title.  “I’m going to night school.”<br/>
“Really?”  Her expression was intrigued, but otherwise unreadable.  “How many classes do you have left?”<br/>
I almost blurted out the same flip reply I always do when a crew mate noticed my school books—a self-deprecating deflection to switch over to some other topic.  Something about her body language made me bite it back. She settled back into the seat, crossing one leg over the other and looking the bot...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>10: Weather</strong><br/>Pamela and I spent the entirety of the storm spinning up and down in opposition to the weather.  The flight would smooth out and we would get more and more agitated, resolved to do something, anything.  The shaking and dips would resume, keeping us in our seats and giving us time to talk through how little we could do.<br/>
And what could we do, really?<br/>
We could have the pilots land the airplane at the nearest airport so we could get the woman to an airport.  But landing in this kind of weather might...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>11: Loop Two</strong><br/>I gasped and fell to my knees as the pressure in my head vanished.<br/>
The sound of breaking glass and the sugary smell of cheap rum were followed by Terry’s exclamation of “Lily!”<br/>
The pressure may have gone, but I still couldn’t quite focus.  I shook my head to clear out the cobwebs.  It only helped a little.<br/>
“I’m fine,” I gasped.  “Sorry.  Just … just give me a sec.”<br/>
I stood, shaky, and leaned back against the storage door, once again whole and right where it was supposed to be.<br/>
“It was different ...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>12: Beverage Service</strong><br/>I made sure to take the front of the drink cart this time.  I wanted to talk to Mr. Dearborn and Mrs. Hamilton in 18.<br/>
It was a weird experience, serving from the front of the cart for the second time.  I hadn’t been paying much attention the first time so I didn’t have the orders memorized, but some of them were … just there.  Like a half-remembered exchange of dialogue from a favorite movie or book.  You don’t quite have it until someone starts saying it, then the words line up and tumble out a...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>13: Manifest</strong><br/>We were back in the galley unloading the cart by 10pm according to the departure clock.  I wanted some time to myself to think.<br/>
“Terry, I can get this.  We’ve got forty-five minutes until the weather hits.  Why don’t you take a load off?”<br/>
He cocked his head but then shrugged.  “Right-o.”  His gaze went to the magazine rack on the bulkhead by the galley.  “I’ll be right back.”<br/>
In the past six months I’d unloaded carts like this more times than I could count, and could probably do it blindfolded. ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>14: Before Weather</strong><br/>I kept my purse in a small storage compartment in the First Class galley.  On most flights I didn’t have any use for it, and First Class was more secure than a similar compartment in Coach as there was far less traffic.  While waiting for the tea to steep I grabbed my school notebook and a pen from my bag.  Also useless on most flights as I wouldn’t have the time to study my notes, they were my constant companions on overnight flights.<br/>
I put them down on my jump seat, telling Pamela as I passed ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>15: Data</strong><br/>I know I’m grasping at straws, I do.<br/>
The knowledge I’m gathering—wait, knowledge is the wrong word.<br/>
The data I’m gathering may be useless.<br/>
Do I really need to know the exact time the weather starts?  Or that Pamela is a third of the way through The Moneychangers, Arthur Hailey’s latest novel about banking industry?<br/>
I don’t yet have a specific plan for the doctors.  I contrived the story to get the manifest so I could be sure of a few names, and Mary Hamilton’s heart condition seemed like a good ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>16: After Weather</strong><br/>The weather came and went, loud and angry but not violent.  I noted the time of the clocks when the ding! Sounded and the FSB light winked out: 12:55 and 3:55.<br/>
Pamela and I didn’t say much to each other this time through the storm.  I gave her more details about my interactions with Dearborn, Hamilton, and Keats, but as she hadn’t experienced it herself this time she was far less concerned.  She’d gone back to her book with a “there’s nothing we can do about it now, anyway” and the rest of the t...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>17: Names</strong><br/>Names are a funny thing for flight attendants.<br/>
Actually, now that I say that out loud, let me be more clear.<br/>
Names are a funny thing for people in a service industry.  Be it flight attendant, bartender, waitress, or the girl slinging beer at baseball games.<br/>
Names are personal.  Using someone’s name is intimate.  Have you ever thought about the rules that go into calling someone by their name?<br/>
If you are good friends you call them by their nickname: Lily.<br/>
If you are acquaintances you call them by...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>18: Daybreak</strong><br/>Terry brought the lights up on schedule while I started up both coffee machines.  Between the lights, activity, and caffeinated aroma, most passengers were already awake by the time Captain Lawrence got on the PA.<br/>
“Good morning everyone and welcome to Florida.  We hope you got some good sleep through last night’s weather—we did our best to keep it smooth.  We’re a half-hour out from Miami International, where the weather is clear and the locals think it’s cold at 72 degrees.”<br/>
That earned him sle...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>19: Loop Three</strong><br/>—on.<br/>
I caught myself against the cart, gasping.  I gritted my teeth as sensation flooded back to me.  The drum section faded out, though I could feel my heart racing.<br/>
Terry stood across from me, eyes wide.<br/>
“Everything all right?”<br/>
How many times had he asked me that?  I started to answer, but rethought my answer.<br/>
“I think I need to eat something before we start.  Do you mind if I take a quick minute?”  I asked, tiling my head toward First Class.  As I said it I realized how true it was—I was gett...</p>
