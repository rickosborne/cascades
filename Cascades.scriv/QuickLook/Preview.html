<p class="binderItem"><strong>1: Cruising Altitude</strong><br/>The speaker crackled and my ears perked up, the response Pavlovian—uncontrollable.<br/>
“Ladies and gentlemen we have reached cruising altitude.”<br/>
My eyes stared at the public address speaker on the wall ahead of me while my hands pulled my bookmark from the back of my book and slid it into place on the current page.<br/>
“I’m turning off the No Smoking sign in the forward cabin,” the ding! chimed over the PA in the same cadence as the man’s speech, as if it was just another piece of punctuation in his sen...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>2: Lily</strong><br/>I should have introduced myself.  Sorry about that.  My head was wrapped up in homework, and then service, and well, you know how it goes.  For someone who is paid to have good manners, I’m not as good at it as I ought to be.<br/>
My name is Lily.  Liliana Theresa Ramirez Alonso, but no one calls me Liliana who isn’t reading my name off a clipboard.<br/>
I’ve been a flight attendant for High Desert Airlines since April, flying since May, for just about six months now.  I admit I’m having a small identity ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>3: After Service</strong><br/>Service was a 40-minute blur.  I checked out somewhere around the third passenger.  When you’re used to being behind a bar keeping a half-dozen orders of far more complex drinks, taking and then serving three at a time requires less brainpower than it does patience.<br/>
We stowed the cart and did one last pass through the cabin before Terry got on the PA.<br/>
“Lily’s coming through the cabin now to collect any leftover service items.  We’re going to dim the lights so everyone can get some sleep.  We’re ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>4: Reserve</strong><br/>I should explain reserve.  I’m not doing a very good job at narrating, sorry.<br/>
I’m what we call “reserve crew”.  Most crew fly the same lines, sequences of flights that usually start and end at the same place so that the crew can feel like they have some semblance of a place to call home.  Good lines are jealously coveted, and are doled out based on your seniority.  Since I’ve only been in the air for six months, I have almost no chance of getting even a decent line.<br/>
Instead, I fly reserve, which...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>5: Descent</strong><br/>I was in the First Class galley when the tail of the plane exploded.<br/>
You don’t have to see something like that happen to know that it did.  When there’s a sudden loud booming noise that reverb-fades into a howling wind just before your ears pop and you find that you can’t breathe too-cold air, well, what else could have happened?<br/>
The ground fell away from my feet and the bulkhead rushed sideways to meet my face.  I got my arms up in time, but I feel something snap in my right forearm before it s...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>6: Awake</strong><br/>“Lily.”<br/>
Oh, hey, that’s me.<br/>
“Lily.”<br/>
Why was someone saying my name?  And saying it wrong.<br/>
“Talk to me, girl.”  Except it was gihl.  Terry?<br/>
I struggled to open my eyes.  A brown haze of a perm surrounded an indistinct face that was tanned to only a few shades lighter.  Terry.<br/>
The synchronized drumbeats in my head and chest began to slow and my senses came back one at a time.<br/>
Hearing: Where was the wind?  It’s so quiet now.<br/>
Smell: Cheap rum.<br/>
Sight: Terry’s face couldn’t have been more than a few i...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>7: Weather</strong><br/>I could feel the gentle bank to port just as I stowed the last of the leftover drinks.  I added two miniature bottles of gin by pushing back a half-dozen bottles of rum, which I’d run back from the cart on an earlier trip to the galley when it had become clear we were going to need far more vodka.  Terry had been a Bloody Mary salesman, convincing passengers that the sugar in the rum would keep them up and that the tomato juice was as close as they’d come to dinner service for the evening.  Betw...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>8: Pageant Pamela</strong><br/>I should mention that I’ve flown with Pamela twice before.  I don’t think either was a long flight, and she’s always in First Class and both times I’d been in Coach as I am now, so we didn’t get much opportunity to chat and get to know each other.  There’s a reason I’ve always seen her work First Class, and for once it has nothing to do with seniority.<br/>
In my mind, Pamela’s full name is Pageant Pamela.  I don’t think I even know her last name, though I admit I must have seen it on a manifest at s...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>9: Authoritative</strong><br/>“It’s a textbook.”  I flipped it up so she could read the title.  “I’m going to night school.”<br/>
“Really?”  Her expression was intrigued, but otherwise unreadable.  “How many classes do you have left?”<br/>
I almost blurted out the same flip reply I always do when a crew mate noticed my school books—a self-deprecating deflection to switch over to some other topic.  Something about her body language made me bite it back. She settled back into the seat, crossing one leg over the other and looking the bot...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>10: Weather</strong><br/>Pamela and I spent the entirety of the storm spinning up and down in opposition to the weather.  The flight would smooth out and we would get more and more agitated, resolved to do something, anything.  The shaking and dips would resume, keeping us in our seats and giving us time to talk through how little we could do.<br/>
And what could we do, really?<br/>
We could have the pilots land the airplane at the nearest airport so we could get the woman to an airport.  But landing in this kind of weather might...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>11: Loop Two</strong><br/>I gasped and fell to my knees as the pressure in my head vanished.<br/>
The sound of breaking glass and the sugary smell of cheap rum were followed by Terry’s exclamation of “Lily!”<br/>
The pressure may have gone, but I still couldn’t quite focus.  I shook my head to clear out the cobwebs.  It only helped a little.<br/>
“I’m fine,” I gasped.  “Sorry.  Just … just give me a sec.”<br/>
I stood, shaky, and leaned back against the storage door, once again whole and right where it was supposed to be.<br/>
“It was different ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>12: Beverage Service</strong><br/>I made sure to take the front of the drink cart this time.  I wanted to talk to Mr. Dearborn and Mrs. Hamilton in 18.<br/>
It was a weird experience, serving from the front of the cart for the second time.  I hadn’t been paying much attention the first time so I didn’t have the orders memorized, but some of them were … just there.  Like a half-remembered exchange of dialogue from a favorite movie or book.  You don’t quite have it until someone starts saying it, then the words line up and tumble out a...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>13: Manifest</strong><br/>We were back in the galley unloading the cart by 10pm according to the departure clock.  I wanted some time to myself to think.<br/>
“Terry, I can get this.  We’ve got forty-five minutes until the weather hits.  Why don’t you take a load off?”<br/>
He cocked his head but then shrugged.  “Right-o.”  His gaze went to the magazine rack on the bulkhead by the galley.  “I’ll be right back.”<br/>
In the past six months I’d unloaded carts like this more times than I could count, and could probably do it blindfolded. ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>14: Before Weather</strong><br/>I kept my purse in a small storage compartment in the First Class galley.  On most flights I didn’t have any use for it, and First Class was more secure than a similar compartment in Coach as there was far less traffic.  While waiting for the tea to steep I grabbed my school notebook and a pen from my bag.  Also useless on most flights as I wouldn’t have the time to study my notes, they were my constant companions on overnight flights.<br/>
I put them down on my jump seat, telling Pamela as I passed ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>15: Data</strong><br/>I know I’m grasping at straws, I do.<br/>
The knowledge I’m gathering—wait, knowledge is the wrong word.<br/>
The data I’m gathering may be useless.<br/>
Do I really need to know the exact time the weather starts?  Or that Pamela is a third of the way through The Moneychangers, Arthur Hailey’s latest novel about banking industry?<br/>
I don’t yet have a specific plan for the doctors.  I contrived the story to get the manifest so I could be sure of a few names, and Mary Hamilton’s heart condition seemed like a good ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>16: After Weather</strong><br/>The weather came and went, loud and angry but not violent.  I noted the time of the clocks when the ding! Sounded and the FSB light winked out: 12:55 and 3:55.<br/>
Pamela and I didn’t say much to each other this time through the storm.  I gave her more details about my interactions with Dearborn, Hamilton, and Keats, but as she hadn’t experienced it herself this time she was far less concerned.  She’d gone back to her book with a “there’s nothing we can do about it now, anyway” and the rest of the t...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>17: Names</strong><br/>Names are a funny thing for flight attendants.<br/>
Actually, now that I say that out loud, let me be more clear.<br/>
Names are a funny thing for people in a service industry.  Be it flight attendant, bartender, waitress, or the girl slinging beer at baseball games.<br/>
Names are personal.  Using someone’s name is intimate.  Have you ever thought about the rules that go into calling someone by their name?<br/>
If you are good friends you call them by their nickname: Lily.<br/>
If you are acquaintances you call them by...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>18: Daybreak</strong><br/>Terry brought the lights up on schedule while I started up both coffee machines.  Between the lights, activity, and caffeinated aroma, most passengers were already awake by the time Captain Lawrence got on the PA.<br/>
“Good morning everyone and welcome to Florida.  We hope you got some good sleep through last night’s weather—we did our best to keep it smooth.  We’re a half-hour out from Miami International, where the weather is clear and the locals think it’s cold at 72 degrees.”<br/>
That earned him sle...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>19: Loop Three</strong><br/>—on.<br/>
I caught myself against the cart, gasping.  I gritted my teeth as sensation flooded back to me.  The drum section faded out, though I could feel my heart racing.<br/>
Terry stood across from me, eyes wide.<br/>
“Everything all right?”<br/>
How many times had he asked me that?  I started to answer, but rethought my answer.<br/>
“I think I need to eat something before we start.  Do you mind if I take a quick minute?”  I asked, tilting my head toward First Class.  As I said it I realized how true it was—I was get...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>20: Common Thread</strong><br/>I’ve got it figured out.<br/>
It took me well into beverage service, but I figured out the commonality between the three explosions.<br/>
At the time of the third explosion I was walking forward to First Class and was almost to the Smoking section.  Terry was working his way backwards to meet me.  Pamela was in First Class.<br/>
For the second explosion I was in a tail lavatory, while Terry and Pamela were in First Class.<br/>
The first explosion found Pamela and me in First Class.  I don’t know exactly where Terry...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>21:  The Rear Guard</strong><br/>I was bored one night in flight attendant school and figured out that it would take something under three minutes to fall from the cruising altitude of a 707.  Row 27 has fallen through the fuselage each time.  I don’t want to think about how awful those three minutes must be for those people, buckled into an uncomfortable foam and aluminum seat that’s plummeting to the ground.<br/>
Between beverage service and lights-out I pulled the manifest ruse again and filled in a new half-dozen names.  This ti...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>22: Duchesne the Magnificent</strong><br/>The 12:55 ding! sounded, releasing me from my confinement in my jump seat.  Two hours of thinking hadn’t gotten me any further along, though it had put me in something of a funk.<br/>
Jim Duchesne was making his way down the aisle as I stepped into the galley.  We shared a smile as he passed.<br/>
I needed a distraction, and I needed something solid and different about this loop to anchor my memories.  When Jim exited the lab I almost pounced on him.<br/>
“Mr. Duchesne.  Jim,” I said to get his attention.<br/>
He d...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>23: And His Lovely Assistant</strong><br/>I flipped the quarter through my fingers for the next two hours and came up with a crazy plan.  The idea grew out of my interaction with Jim: if sight lines wouldn’t let me be unseen in the back, I’d have to do the trick in plain sight, with a bit of misdirection.<br/>
I caught Jim as he exited the lavatory just before lights-up.<br/>
“Hey, Jim.  Can I talk with you for a minute?”<br/>
He cocked his head at me, but followed as I beckoned him to step into the galley.<br/>
“Is something wrong?”<br/>
I leaned in close enou...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>24: Suspension of Service</strong><br/>I felt the reset happen and was ready for it.  I snapped back to the drink cart with only a gasp and a slight buckling of the knees.  I felt like I had stuck the landing, but Terry noticed.<br/>
“Everything all right?”<br/>
The headache and hunger kicked in.  I could feel my hear ratchet up from calm.  I put a finger across my lips and threw my eyes at the passengers.<br/>
“I’m thinking,” I said as I stepped backward to put my back against the storage closet door, “that I probably overstocked the rum.”<br/>
I opene...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>25: A Better Plan</strong><br/>Beverage service was interesting.<br/>
Terry was distracted, disengaged from what he was doing.  This was the fifth time I’d worked with him on this service and I’d gotten used to hearing his lip service about Bloody Marys.  This time there was none and except for taking orders he worked almost in silence.  This threw off our alcohol balance, twice causing him to go back to the galley to restock.<br/>
However, the reduced cross-selling did speed up the service.  We managed to recoup the time I’d lost in t...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>26: Welcome Back</strong><br/>And blacked out, apparently.  The next thing I was aware of was Pamela next to me, telling me that I was going to be okay, stroking my forehead.  My brain felt like it was tumbling around inside a washing machine.<br/>
I looked at my leg, propped up on the jump seat.  I expected to see it as well as my skirt hiked up around my waist, but didn’t.  I was covered, toes to torso, in a pile of black nylon that I recognized as the parachute.<br/>
“How long?”<br/>
“Oh,” Pamela said, glancing at her watch, “maybe ten ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>27: Montreal</strong><br/>Like Nadia Comăneci, I stuck the landing.  Terry saw me get weak at the knees and have to prop myself up, but I smiled it away.  Okay, so maybe I didn’t get a 10.0 from the Australian judge.<br/>
“Hey, I can feel a headache coming on.  I’m going to grab some aspirin and a sandwich real quick if that’s okay with you?”<br/>
I was reaching for the aspirin as he nodded, this time shaking four out of the bottle.  My free left hand scratched absently at my thigh as I knocked back the pills.  My knee felt warm t...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>28: Taps</strong><br/>Four hours.<br/>
The loops start at 9:14 and the weather doesn’t clear until 12:55.  I had to wait a few extra minutes for Jim Duchesne to settle in and fall asleep, so by the time I could get to the case I’d been thinking about it for four hours.<br/>
Imagine my frustration when I realized that I couldn’t just go straight for the case.  Instead, I needed to see how Irene was going to get to it.<br/>
First, I need to give her opportunity.  I know she keeps an eye on our movements and waits until after we’re ou...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>29: Footsie</strong><br/>I thought it through, front to back, and I couldn’t figure out any other way.  I needed help.  There was no way for me to get her purse—it was on the floor between her feet, past the two men sleeping beside her.<br/>
Harold Sr. was not thrilled that I woke him when I saw Irene nod off.  I whispered into his ear that it was an emergency and asked him to follow me, quietly.  His eyes got big but he pushed himself out of his seat without a word.<br/>
“Mr. Grant, I need your help,” I told him in a low voice w...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>30: Buying Time</strong><br/>“How much longer can we stay up here?”<br/>
“Excuse me?” Simon retorted.<br/>
“I am certain there is pressure switch on the bomb.  It will explode if we descend.”<br/>
“How do you know?”<br/>
Trial and error.<br/>
“How I know is not important.  I know.”  I looked each of them in the eyes.  “Look at me.  Do I seem unsure?”<br/>
Lawrence picked up a clipboard and pencil.  While I stared the others down, he did the math.<br/>
“An extra fifty minutes.  Maybe fifty-five.  Then we’re in the Atlantic.”<br/>
“No, then we’re in pieces.  The bo...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>31: The Importance Of</strong><br/>“I need you to unbuckle and come with me,” I whispered into Ernest’s ear.<br/>
“Is there a problem?”  He didn’t move.<br/>
I didn’t respond.  I stood up and stared at him, extending my hand as if to present the Smoking section to him.<br/>
“Right this way, sir,” I said for the audience.<br/>
One look at Mary told me all that I needed to know.  There was no rise and fall of her blankets as she breathed.  I let my gaze linger on her, then over to Ernest, to underline the situation.<br/>
It was detente, our own little Cold...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>32: Miami Center</strong><br/>I told Ernest to clean himself up in the First Class lavatory, then to get back to his seat.<br/>
“You’re going to want to hear this,” I crooked a finger at Pam, then walked to the cockpit door and knocked.  “It’s Lily and Pamela,” I announced.<br/>
The door opened with a click.  Simon had us lock the door behind ourselves as we entered.<br/>
“I know what’s going on.  It’s espionage,” I told them all.  “We’re in the middle of a James Bond movie.”<br/>
Simon, as usual, did not like what I had to say.  “Some Bond gir...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>33: Granted</strong><br/>“People are going to start waking up.  You need to keep them up front and calm,” I said to Terry.<br/>
“Do you think she’ll tell you how to …”<br/>
“I hope so, because I’m running out of ideas.”  The arrival clock read a quarter after six.  “Lights are up in fifteen minutes, which we can maybe push to thirty if not too many people wake up.  We fall out of the sky less than an hour later.  I’ve got to try something.”<br/>
I stepped up to row 27 and tapped Harold Sr. on the shoulder, beckoning him back to the ga...</p>

“I’ve been doing this backwards,” I told him.  “That doesn’t make sense yet, but it will.”<br/>
I moved to the intercom and called the cockpit.  Simon answered.<br/>
“Captain, we have a sandstorm.”<br/>
“That’s not funny.  Who is this?  Reserve girl?”<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>35: Concourse</strong><br/>On the ground, I spent four hours explaining the same story over and over again to the police, the airport and airline officials, Terry, Pamela, Simon, and Lawrence, and many other people with badges.  Some time around 1am Pacific they released me for the night.  I had to be back for more questioning in the morning, but for now I had a reservation for my own hotel room and a date with a pillow.<br/>
“What did you tell them?” asked a voice behind me as I walked through the main concourse.  I turned to...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>36: Dinner</strong><br/>I jabbed a trio of fries into the paper ramekin of ketchup.<br/>
“So who are you?”<br/>
“I work with Dr. Hamilton.”<br/>
“At NASA?”<br/>
Jennifer shrugged, equivocating.<br/>
“Ish.  Let’s say we’re government contractors and leave it at that.”  She took a massive bite from the burger in her hands.<br/>
“And Dearborn?”<br/>
“Also worked with us.”<br/>
“Irene?”<br/>
“Not sure, though I have my suspicions.”<br/>
I shoveled more fries into my mouth, alternating with sips of my drink.  I was hungrier than I’d realized.  I lowered my voice, even thou...</p>
