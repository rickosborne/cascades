<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 1: Cruising Altitude</strong><br/>The speaker crackled and my ears perked up, the response Pavlovian—uncontrollable.<br/>
“Alright, ladies and gentlemen.  We’ve reached cruising altitude.”<br/>
My eyes stared at the public address speaker on the wall ahead of me while my hands pulled my bookmark from the back of my book and slid it into place on the current page.<br/>
“I’m turning off the No Smoking sign in the forward cabin,” the ding! chimed over the PA in the same cadence as the man’s speech, as if it was just another piece of punctuation i...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 2: Lily</strong><br/>I should have introduced myself.  Sorry about that.  My head was wrapped up in homework, and then service, and well, you know how it goes.  For someone who is paid to have good manners, I’m not as good at it as I ought to be.<br/>
My name is Lily.  Liliana Theresa Ramirez Alonso, but no one calls me Liliana who isn’t reading my name off a clipboard.<br/>
I’ve been a flight attendant for High Desert Airlines since April, flying since May, for just about six months now.  I admit I’m having a small identity ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Scene 3: After Service</strong><br/>Service was a 40-minute blur.  I checked out somewhere around the third passenger.  When you’re used to being behind a bar keeping a half-dozen orders of far more complex drinks, taking and then serving three at a time requires less brainpower than it does patience.<br/>
We stowed the cart and did one last pass through the cabin before Terry got on the PA.<br/>
“Lily’s coming through the cabin now to collect any leftover service items.  We’re going to dim the lights so everyone can get some sleep.  We’re ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>4: Reserve</strong><br/>I should explain reserve.  I’m not doing a very good job at narrating, sorry.<br/>
I’m what we call “reserve crew”.  Most crew fly the same lines, sequences of flights that usually start and end at the same place so that the crew can feel like they have some semblance of a place to call home.  Good lines are jealously coveted, and are doled out based on your seniority.  Since I’ve only been in the air for six months, I have almost no chance of getting even a decent line.<br/>
Instead, I fly reserve, which...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>5: Descent</strong><br/>I was in the First Class galley when the tail of the plane exploded.<br/>
You don’t have to see something like that happen to know that it did.  When there’s a sudden loud booming noise that reverb-fades into a howling wind just before your ears pop and you find that you can’t breathe too-cold air, well, what else could have happened?<br/>
The ground fell away from my feet and the bulkhead rushed sideways to meet my face.  I got my arms up in time, but I feel something snap in my right forearm before it s...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>6</strong><br/>“Lily.”<br/>
Oh, hey, that’s me.<br/>
“Lily.”<br/>
Why was someone saying my name?  And saying it wrong.<br/>
“Talk to me, girl.”  Except it was “gihl”.  Terry?<br/>
I struggled to open my eyes.  A brown haze of a perm surrounded an indistinct face that was tanned to only a few shades lighter.  Terry.<br/>
The synchronized drumbeats in my head and chest began to slow and my senses came back one at a time.<br/>
Hearing: Where was the wind?  It’s so quiet now.<br/>
Smell: Cheap rum.<br/>
Sight: Terry’s face couldn’t have been more than a few...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>7: Weather</strong><br/>I could feel the gentle bank to port just as I stowed the last of the leftover drinks.  I added two miniature bottles of gin by pushing back a half-dozen bottles of rum, which I’d run back from the cart on an earlier trip to the galley when it had become clear we were going to need far more vodka.  Terry had been a bloody mary salesman, convincing passengers that the sugar in the rum would keep them up and that the tomato juice was as close as they’d come to dinner service for the evening.  Betw...</p>
