The following is a list of commercial short-haul civilian passenger "regional" airliners with significant build numbers. Regional airliners typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and fill the short-hop role in the hub and spoke model of passenger and cargo distribution as well as taking part in point-to-point transit.

Designed in the 1960s as a replacement for the Beechcraft Model 18, its first flight was in July 1966. It received type certification on May 2, 1968, and sixty-two aircraft were delivered by the end of the year.

In 1984, the Beechcraft 1900, a pressurized 19-passenger airplane, was introduced as the follow on aircraft.

Production ended in early 1987. Nearly half the Beech 99s in airline service are now operated as freighters by Ameriflight.

In July 2011 a total of 130 Beech 99 aircraft remained in civil service, all but two of them in North and South America. Major operators included Alpine Air Express (12 aircraft), Ameriflight (57), Bemidji Airlines (11), and Wiggins Airways (10) with these aircraft primarily being operated in air freight operations. 22 other airlines and the National Police of Colombia operated smaller numbers of the type.Wiggins was acquired by Ameriflight and is the biggest operator of the type.[1] In June 2015, Lake Clark Air was operating a Beech 99 from Port Alsworth, AK.[2]

Buran (spacecraft)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This article is about the orbiter launched in 1988. For the Soviet/Russian reusable space program, see Buran program.
Buran
Буран

Orbiter 1K1 at an airshow at Le Bourget in 1989
Country	Soviet Union
Named after	"Snowstorm"[1]
Status	destroyed in a 2002 hangar collapse[2]
First flight	15 November 1988[1]
Last flight	15 November 1988[1]
Number of missions	1[1]
Crew members	0[1]
Time spent in space	3 hours, 36 minutes
Number of orbits	2[1]
Buran (Russian: Бура́н, IPA: [bʊˈran], Snowstorm or Blizzard) was the first space shuttle orbiter to be produced as part of the Soviet/Russian Buran program. It carried the GRAU index serial number 11F35 K1 and is – depending on the source – also known as OK-1K1, Orbiter K1, OK 1.01 or Shuttle 1.01. Besides describing the first operational Soviet/Russian shuttle orbiter, "Buran" was also the designation for the whole Soviet/Russian space shuttle project.

OK-1K1 completed one unmanned spaceflight in 1988 and was destroyed in 2002, when the hangar it was stored in collapsed.[3] It remains the only Soviet reusable spacecraft to be launched into space. The Buran-class space shuttle orbiters used the expendable Energia rocket as launch vehicle.

Main article: Buran program
The construction of the Buran-class space shuttle orbiters began in 1980, and by 1984 the first full-scale orbiter was rolled out. Construction of a second orbiter (OK-1K2, informally known as "Ptichka") started in 1988. The Buran program was officially canceled in 1993.


Orbiter OK-1K1 Buran during launch on 15 November 1988
The only orbital launch of a Buran-class orbiter occurred at 3:00 UTC on 15 November 1988 from Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad 110/37. OK-1K1 was lifted into space, on an unmanned mission, by the specially designed Energia rocket. The automated launch sequence performed as specified, and the Energia rocket lifted the vehicle into a temporary orbit before the orbiter separated as programmed. After boosting itself to a higher orbit and completing two revolutions around the Earth, ODU (engine control system) engines fired automatically to begin the descent into the atmosphere.

Exactly 206 minutes[4] into the mission, Orbiter OK-1K1 landed, having lost only eight of its 38,000 thermal tiles over the course of the flight.[5] The automated landing took place on a runway at Baikonur Cosmodrome where, despite a lateral wind speed of 61.2 kilometres per hour (38.0 mph), it landed only 3 metres (9.8 ft) laterally and 10 metres (33 ft) longitudinally from the target mark.[4] Specifically, as Buran approached Baikonur Cosmodrome and started landing, spacecraft sensors detected the strong crosswind and "the robotic system sent the huge machine for another rectangular traffic pattern approach, successfully landing the spacecraft on a second try."[5] It was the first space shuttle to perform an unmanned flight, including landing in fully automatic mode.

In 1989, it was projected that OK-1K1 would have an unmanned second flight by 1993, with a duration of 15–20 days.[6] Because the Buran program was cancelled after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, this never took place.

On 12 May 2002,[3] a hangar at the Baikonur Cosmodrome housing OK-1K1 collapsed during a massive storm in Kazakhstan, as a result of poor maintenance. The collapse killed eight workers and destroyed the craft as well as a mock-up of an Energia carrier rocket.[7][8][9]

The Metroliner was an evolution of the Swearingen Merlin turboprop-powered business aircraft. Ed Swearingen, a Texas fixed base operator (FBO), started the developments that led to the Metro through gradual modifications to the Beechcraft Twin Bonanza and Queen Air business aircraft, aircraft which he dubbed Excalibur.

A new fuselage (but with a similar nose) and vertical fin were then developed, married to salvaged and rebuilt (wet) Queen Air wings and horizontal tails, and Twin Bonanza landing gear; this became the SA26 Merlin, more-or-less a pressurized Excalibur. Through successive models (the SA26-T Merlin IIA and SA26-AT Merlin IIB) the engines were changed to Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6, then Garrett TPE331 turboprops. These were marketed as business aircraft seating eight to ten passengers.

An all-new aircraft was built and named the SA226-T Merlin III with a new nose, wings, landing gear, cruciform horizontal tail[note 1] and inverted inlet Garrett engines. Ultimately a stretch of the Merlin III was designed, sized to seat 22 passengers and called the SA226-TC Metro. Because FAA regulations limited an airliner to no more than 19 seats if no flight attendant was to be carried, the aircraft was optimized for that number of passengers. The standard engines offered were two TPE331-3UW turboprops driving three-bladed propellers. A corporate version called the SA226-AT Merlin IVA was also marketed and initially sales of this version were roughly double that of the Metro.[1]

Prototype construction of the Metro began in 1968 and the first flight was on August 26, 1969. Swearingen Aircraft encountered financial difficulties at this stage, and late in 1971 Fairchild (which was marketing the Metro[2] and building its wings and engine nacelles), bought 90% of Swearingen and the company was renamed Swearingen Aviation Corporation. It was at this point that the previously cash-strapped company was able to put the Metro into production.[3][4][5]

In 1974, the original Metro models were replaced by the SA226-TC Metro II after about 20 Metros and about 30 Merlin IVAs had been built.[note 2] Among the changes made were larger, squared-oval windows and optional provision for a small Rocket-Assisted Take Off (RATO) rocket in the tail cone, this being offered to improve takeoff performance out of "hot &amp; high" airfields in the event of an engine failure.

The Metro and Metro II were limited to a maximum weight of 12,500 pounds (5,670 kg) in the USA and countries using imperial units, and 5,700 kg in countries using SI units. When this restriction was lifted the Metro II was re-certified as the Metro IIA in 1980 with a maximum weight of 13,100 pounds (5,941 kg) and the Metro II's TPE331-3 engines replaced by -10 engines of increased power.

The SA227-AC Metro III followed, also initially certified in 1980 for up to 14,000 pounds (6,350 kg), this increasing to 14,500 pounds (6,577 kg) as engines and structures were upgraded. An option to go as high as 16,000 pounds (7,257 kg) was offered. Externally, improvements incorporated into the Metro III were a 10 ft (3.05 m) increase in wing span, four-bladed props, redesigned "quick-access" engine cowlings and numerous drag-reducing airframe modifications, including landing gear doors that closed after the gear was extended.

Once again a corporate version was offered as the Merlin IVC (the model name was chosen to align with the contemporaneous short-fuselage Merlin IIIC). A version with strengthened floors and the high gross weight option was offered as a cargo aircraft known as the Expediter. Both the Expediter and the Merlin IVC were designated the SA227-AT. Finally, due to reliability problems with Garrett engines in the second half of the 1980s, the Metro IIIA was offered with two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-45R turboprops in place of the Garrett units; however none were actually delivered.[6] A special model was the SA227-BC Metro III built for Mexican airline AeroLitoral, which took delivery of 15 of the 18 of this model that were produced.

Improvements beyond the Metro III provided better systems, more power and a further increase in takeoff weight. This design effort resulted in the SA227 CC (for Commuter Category) and SA227-DC models, initially called the Metro IV[6] then renamed Metro 23, so named as they were designed for certification under FAR Part 23 (Amendment 34) standards. A Metro 23 EF with an external pod under the lower fuselage for greater baggage capacity was also offered as well as an Expediter 23 and Merlin 23. The SA227-CC was an interim model with TPE331-11U engines and only a handful were built.[5][7]

In the 1960s Swearingen Aircraft developed a prototype SA-28T eight-seat jet aircraft with a flapless delta wing.[2][8] It shared the tail and cockpit with the Merlin/Metro. The two engines were to be Garrett TFE731 turbofans then in development;[9] they were originally to be mounted on the aft fuselage, however during the course of design work their location was moved to under the high-mounted wing.[10] Early flights were to be undertaken with General Electric CJ610 engines fitted. Development continued after Fairchild acquired the company,[11] but the project was shut down nine weeks from first flight. It was later cut up as scrap and the fuselage used as a Metro display at trade shows.[citation needed]

At the 1987 Paris Air Show, Fairchild released details of proposed developments of the Metro designated the Metro V and Metro VI. These versions would have featured a longer fuselage with a taller "stand-up" cabin providing 69 in (180 cm) of interior height for passengers; a redesigned, longer wing; engines moved further out on the wing from the fuselage; a "T-tail" and various system improvements. A Merlin V corporate version of the Metro V was also planned. The Metro V was to be fitted with the same engines as the Metro 23 and the Metro VI was to be fitted with more powerful TPE331-14 engines.[6][12] The Metro VI was shelved within months of being announced due to a lack of customer interest,[13] but Fairchild did not proceed with the Metro V either.

One version that did see the light of day was the Metro 25, which featured an increased passenger capacity of 25 at the expense of the baggage space found in earlier models; the deletion of the left rear cargo door, the addition of a passenger door on the right-hand rear fuselage, and a belly pod for baggage. A Metro III was converted as a Metro 25 demonstrator, it flew in this configuration in October 1989.[14] Also mooted but not built was the Metro 25J, which would have been another jet-powered aircraft with TFE731s in over-wing pods.[12]

The type certificates for Metro and Merlin aircraft are currently held by M7 Aerospace.


Bearskin Airlines C-FXUS SA227 CC model, Winnipeg c.2007

One of the advantages of the Perimeter Aviation modifications was using a four-bladed propeller that was less susceptible to stone chips on gravel runways
Two of the original Metro model were delivered in 1972 to Societe Miniere de Bakwanga (MIBA) in Kinshasa, Zaire, the first customer to put the Metro into service. The first airline to put them into service was Commuter Airlines in January 1973,[4] followed shortly after by Air Wisconsin.

At least one Metro IIA flies in Canada with Perimeter Aviation.[15] Two SA227-CCs are today registered with Canadian operator Bearskin Lake Air Service Ltd.,[16] while another two are operating in New Zealand.[17] A fifth also flew with Bearskin Airlines but was destroyed in a mid-air collision in 1995.[18]

In service with Perimeter Aviation in Canada, this long-term operator of the Metro II made a number of modifications to suit its use in northern and remote Canadian sites where rudimentary gravel "strips" were common. Some of the many innovative changes to the design of the Metro allowed the aircraft to fly more efficiently as well as cutting down on the "noise factor" that was attributed to the early models. The airline installed Garrett engines with quieter and more efficient four-bladed Hartzell propellers. Their Metros are also all equipped with modern avionics suites including certified AlliedSignal KLN 90B GPS.

Many of the improvements resulting in the Metro 23 came about during work to produce the military C-26B model for the United States Air Force.

A Metro III aircraft was modified for the Colombian Air Force for counternarcotics reconnaissance purposes.[19] The Colombian National Police also operates several Metro 23 aircraft for counternarcotics reconnaissance purposes.[20][21] In addition, the Peruvian Air Force operates a Metro 23 and the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard operates a Metro III, both similarly configured.[22][23] A "Regional Security System" Metro III with a large belly radome has been seen in the Caribbean.[24][25]

In civilian service the type has proved to be popular, with sales in the 19-seat airliner market rivalled only by the Beechcraft 1900.[note 3] It is especially popular in Australia. Since the first example (a Merlin IVA) arrived in 1975, almost 20% of the fleet has operated in that country. As of December 2008, 61 Metros and Expediters are registered in Australia, more than all of its market rivals combined.[26]

Metro production ended in 1998, however by this time Regional Jets were in vogue and turboprop types were out of favour with airlines, and several airframes remained unsold at the factory. The final aircraft, Metro 23 c/n DC-904B, was not delivered (to air charter company National Jet Aviation Services of Zelienople, Pennsylvania) until 2001.[4] A total of 703 Metro, Expediter, Merlin IV series and C-26 series aircraft were built.[5] In addition, 158 other SA226 and SA227 series aircraft were built as short-fuselage Merlin IIIs, IIIAs and IIIBs.[note 4]

On June 12, 1980, a Metro II operating as Air Wisconsin Flight 965 suffered engine failure following massive water ingestion during a thunderstorm; the crew lost control and crashed near Valley, Nebraska. Both crew members and 11 passengers died; two passengers survived with serious injuries.[38]
On January 15, 1987, a Metro II operating as Skywest Airlines Flight 1834 collided with a single engine Mooney M-20 near Kearns Utah. All eight people on the Metro II were killed in the accident.[39]
On January 19, 1988, a Fairchild Metro III operating as Trans-Colorado Airlines Flight 2286 under the Continental Express brand, crashed near Bayfield, Colorado. Both crew members and seven of the 15 passengers died. Of the surviving passengers, only one was uninjured.[40]
On February 8, 1988, a Metro III operating as Nürnberger Flugdienst Flight 108 suffered a lightning strike, following which the electrical system failed. The right wing separated from the aircraft during an uncontrolled descent and the aircraft disintegrated and crashed near Kettwig, Germany. Both crew members and all 19 passengers died.[41]
On February 19, 1988, a Fairchild Metro operating as AVAir Flight 3378 crashed one mile from the runway after takeoff from Raleigh-Durham International Airport, North Carolina. Pilot error was found to be the cause.
On September 26, 1989, Skylink Airlines Flight 070, a Fairchild Metro III was on a scheduled flight from Vancouver(YVR) to Terrace (YXT), British Columbia with two pilots and five passengers on board. The aircraft crashed one quarter mile to the west of Terrace Airport while the crew was attempting to carry out a missed approach in IFR conditions. The aircraft was destroyed by the impact and a post-crash fire. All seven occupants were fatally injured in the crash.[42]
On February 1, 1991, SkyWest Airlines Flight 5569, operated with a Metro III, was waiting on a runway when USAir Flight 1493 collided with it, resulting in the death of the ten passengers and two crew members on board the Metro.
On May 1, 1995, a Metro 23 operating as Bearskin Airlines Flight 362 (with a crew of two and one passenger on board) collided at 4,500 feet above sea level with an Air Sandy Piper PA-31 Navajo (with one pilot and four passengers on board) while on approach to Sioux Lookout Airport, destroying both aircraft and killing all persons on both aircraft.[43]
On September 16, 1995, a Tamair Metro III, VH-NEJ, crashed shortly after takeoff from Tamworth, NSW, Australia, killing all three on board. The crash occurred following a "V1 cut" at night and raised many questions regarding the safety of asymmetric training operations at night.[44]
On June 18, 1998, Propair Flight 420, a Metro II flying from Dorval International Airport (now Montreal-Trudeau International Airport) to Peterborough Airport in Peterborough, Ontario, experienced a wing/engine fire during the initial climb. It attempted an emergency landing at Mirabel, but crashed near the runway threshold, in part due to a landing gear failure. The two pilots and the nine passengers on board were killed.[45]
On May 3, 2005, a Metro III operating a cargo flight as Airwork Flight 23 broke up in midair and crashed near Stratford, New Zealand. Both crew members died.
On May 7, 2005, a Transair Metro 23 crashed near Lockhart River, north of Cooktown, Queensland in Australia. A total of 15 people died in what is, as of December 2009, the worst airline crash in Australia since the 1960s.[46][47]
On February 10, 2011, Manx2 Flight 7100, a Metro III owned by the Spanish airline Air Lada operating on behalf of Manx2, was on a flight from Belfast, Northern Ireland to Cork, Ireland. The aircraft crashed on landing in fog, resulting in the death of six people.[48]
On September 6, 2011, Aerocon Flight 238 from El Trompillo Airport, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia to Teniente Jorge Henrich Arauz Airport, Trinidad, Bolivia crashed on approach to Trinidad. The flight was operated by Swearingen SA-227 Metroliner CP-2548. Eight of the nine people on board were killed.[49]
On June 6, 2012, a SA227-C metro en route from Montevideo Carrasco, MVD to Buenos Aires Ezeiza (EZE) crashed into the Rio de la Plata close to the coast of Montevideo south of Flores Island. It was registered as CX-LAS operating a freight flight on behalf of DHL.[50]
On November 3, 2013, a Metro III, CP-2477 Aerocon airliner crashed when it was trying to land at the airport in Riberalta Airport (northern Bolivia) that killed eight people.[51]
On November 10, 2013 a Metroliner operated by Bearskin Airlines under flight number JV311, crashed on final approach to its destination of Red Lake, Ontario, Canada en route from Sioux Lookout, Ontario. The aircraft experienced a near total failure of the left engine at 500 ft AGL which, combined with the aircraft being in the landing configuration, caused a loss of airspeed resulting in an unrecoverable situation. Safety systems to assist in the handling with one engine out did not activate since the engine did not completely shut down; the scenario gave conflicting information to the pilots who did not have time to identify the nature of the failure. Two crew members and three passengers were killed in the crash. Two passengers sustained injuries but survived.[52]
On December 2, 2013, a Metroliner property of IBC Airways, flying from Las Américas International Airport, Dominican Republic, crashed in the municipality of Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Two people were killed in the accident.[53]
On April 13, 2015, a Carson Air SA-226 Metro II disappeared somewhere in the North Shore Mountains after taking off from Vancouver International Airport for Prince George Airport. Debris was found near the area where the aircraft was last tracked.[54]
On June 2, 2015, a Aeronaves TSM Fairchild (Swearingen) SA226TC Metro II, registration XA-UKP (msn TC-376 built 1980) crashed shortly after take-off from Querétaro international airport, Queretaro State, Mexico.[55]

Douglas DC-8 of Overseas National Airways in its tribute to the U.S.A.'s Bicentennial Commemorative livery at Zurich in 1975

SkyWest Airlines celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2007. Notice the red and blue nontraditional "wavy" cheatline along the fuselage compared to the more traditional linear cheatline of American Eagle regional jet in the background.
An aircraft livery is a paint scheme applied to an aircraft, generally to fuselage, wings, empennage (tail fin), or jet engines. To promote their brand, airlines typically use a standard livery, prominently displaying their logo or name, that is applied to all or most of their fleet. Special liveries are used in certain circumstances, such as significant anniversaries for an airline or as part of a marketing agreement. Government and military aircraft also have liveries. The term is derived from the more general term livery.

A Douglas DC-3 in a bare metal fuselage livery
Bare metal aircraft liveries are somewhat synonymous with the advances to aircraft technology during the 1930s and the tremendous sales success of the Douglas DC-3. What has often been called one of the first modern airliners which could actually turn a meaningful profit for airlines, the Douglas DC-3's sleek and shiny aluminum fuselage wings and body represented the latest in streamlining aircraft for increased speeds; this came at a time when many aircraft were still fabricated out of wood and canvas. Correspondingly, companies like Eastern Air Lines, Delta Air Lines, and American Airlines (now very well known for its distinctive bare-metal liveries) chose to leave their aircraft unpainted as a clear sign they operated the speediest and most up to date fleets. During more recent times others such as Air Canada, US Airways, Western Airlines, Pan Am, Aeromexico, Jat Airways, Northwest Airlines, and Cathay Pacific also maintained unpainted airplanes along significant portions of their histories.

Among some advantages of not painting aircraft surfaces, this type of paint scheme reduces weight and therefore results in fuel savings; however, some analysts estimate that the extra cost to maintain and polish a bare metal scheme outweighs the fuel saving benefits.[1]


A British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) VC10 with a cheatline running the length of the fuselage
A cheatline is decorative, horizontal, single or multiple, band of color or colors applied to the sides of a fuselage. Historically, the cheatline was located at or just below an aircraft's window line. However, in more recent times it has migrated and increasingly has become less laterally based.


A Pan Am A310 with billboard livery titles
With the introduction of wide-body aircraft, a new form of livery also came about called the billboard livery. With billboard liveries the name of the airline became the unique and main feature of an airline's livery. By abandoning the cheatline that had traditionally run the length of the aircraft along the window-line; billboard liveries extend the name of the airline above and below the window-line in a much larger script. Early adopters of this style of airline livery were Union de Transports Aériens (UTA), Pan Am and AVENSA. Hughes Airwest adopted a billboard livery after the Flight 706 disaster. Other examples include Braniff with their 747SPs, Muse Air along their McDonnell Douglas aircraft, and Frontier Airlines along their Airbus aircraft. In recent years, two of the three main airline alliances have uniquely adopted billboard titling for their advertising branding and joint airline liveries.


A PLUNA Bombardier CRJ900 with a jelly bean livery
These liveries are characterized by the vertical stabilizer and sometimes aft fuselage being painted in multiple designs.

The most notable jelly bean livery used among North America airlines is the design concept introduced by Braniff International Airlines in November 1965, as part of their "End of the Plain Plane" campaign: there were 7 different, solid-colored schemes featuring pastel colors on the fuselage, white wings and tail, and formal black titles and nose.

A slight variant of the jelly bean concept is the "jelly tails" of JetBlue Airways, Mexicana, Frontier Airlines, and Air-India Express. British Airways' short lived Newell and Sorrell World Tails design featured jelly bean liveries. PLUNA of Uruguay is one of the most recent airlines to adopt this attractive and colorful corporate imagery.


ATA Airlines Boeing 757-200 and 727-200 in the 25th commemorative anniversary livery

South African Airways Boeing 747-300 Ndizani
Commemorative liveries are used to celebrate a milestone in an airline's history, including anniversaries.

One such example would be ATA Airlines 25th anniversary paint scheme, celebrating the airline's inception under George Mikelson, the founder of American Trans Air,[2] or SkyWest Airlines paint scheme used to commemorate the 30th anniversary of that airline.

South African Airways had one of their Boeing 747-300s specially painted in rainbow colors to transport the South African Olympic team to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The aircraft was fondly dubbed the Ndizani.


Garuda Indonesia Boeing 737-800 retro/heritage livery
A heritage livery is a livery that an airline has used in the past (apart from any modern livery used by an airline). Some airlines use these as a one off paint scheme applied to only one or two aircraft in their current fleet, as a tribute to their past. Airlines, the media, and enthusiasts call an aircraft painted in a heritage livery a retrojet.[3]

Airlines often apply and paint specialized liveries to their standard airline liveries and logos of their aircraft, examples being:


Alaska Airlines added a Hawaiian Lei to some of its Boeing 737 aircraft
a logo when used for charter service; sports teams and touring rock bands are common examples
a logo of a prominent charity, when the airline and charity have a partnership
images of a city, usually a hub or other city of importance to the airline
advertising for a company (logojet)
Southwest Airlines is famous for its various liveries promoting Sea World (painted to resemble an Orca), various US states where Southwest has operations (painted to resemble the states' flags), and other entities such as the NBA and the Ronald McDonald House.

Alliance liveries

A Delta Air Lines Boeing 757-200 in the SkyTeam livery

A Scandinavian Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-81 in Star Alliance livery. Normally this livery features the airline's logo underneath the Star Alliance title

Boeing 777-200ER (N791AN), in the new standard Oneworld livery
Three multinational worldwide airline alliances have grown and developed their own aircraft liveries and corporate identities which encompass and transcend major carriers, mainline carriers, legacy carriers, and flag airlines' individual airline identities along with any ties to regional, geopolitical, national boundaries, and government heritages.

Oneworld, SkyTeam, and Star Alliance are the mutually agreed upon "airline alliance liveries" of large numbers of independent and separately owned airlines working together as one through a system of codeshare agreements, rather than the colors of any one certificated airline.

Unlike the other airline alliance consortium members, Oneworld will retain the "jellytail" airline logo markings of their individual airline alliance partner members upon each member airline's vertical stabilizer.

Similar in terms of how multiple different airlines fly aircraft in full branding of standard OneWorld, SkyTeam, and Star Alliance liveries, in the United States along with many other parts of the world, large airlines often operate in association with other airlines which operate much smaller regional airliners so smaller communities are linked to an airlines large airline hub.


An AmericanConnection Embraer ERJ-140 operated by Chautauqua Airlines
To promote and offer air travelers with what appears as a "seamless" association with a much larger more prominent, well known, and publically perceived as "more safe" major, mainline, legacy, discount, or flag carrier, airline; North American airlines have developed a system of affiliate air carriers.

These feeder airlines which operate aircraft such as the regional jets and other types of smaller utility air-taxi type aircraft, painted to mimmick the well known airline; they often carry the names Airlink, Connection, Eagle, or Express, next to the traditional network airlines highly regarded branding or name.

A recent trend, in North America is for the regional airline d/b/a Express, Eagle, or Connection, is to operate the aircraft in full mainline airline markings, leaving the operating regional airlines name in only very small letters, close to the forward entry door. Such brandings noted to cause confusion among travelers, as in the case of Colgan Air Continental Express flight disaster, often stimulate added confusion when operations do not go as planned due to inclimate weather and other acts of god, and the ensuing fee changes during rebooking, or other ticketing.


VC-25 in Air Force One livery, with the Seal of the President of the United States.
Air transports of heads of state and government are often painted in unique color schemes. The US President's aircraft, Air Force One, uses a light-blue and sky-blue color scheme, with the Seal of the President of the United States just above the front gear and the flag of the United States on the tailfin designed by French-American industrial designer Raymond Loewy.[4]

An aircraft used to transport state or government leaders is often painted in a livery that represents national colors of a country or colors of a particular government office, and most of the time is coordinated with a flag, seal, and other insignia.

Main article: Aircraft camouflage
See also: Active camouflage
Military aircraft often make use of aircraft camouflage to make the aircraft more difficult to see in the air and on the ground. This form of camouflage makes use of light and color patterns, and is dependent upon environmental conditions and is mainly effective against human observers, though some electronic visual acquisition systems can be affected. Visual camouflage does not protect an aircraft against radar location or heat-seeking electronics.

Since the release of MIL-STD-2161 in 1993, the US Navy's tactical aircraft use a color scheme designed to reduce visual detection that consists of shades of flat gray with exterior markings applied in a contrasting shade of gray.[5] Note that the stated purpose of this document is to standardize paint schemes and application of naval insignia and markings.

Aircraft camouflage was first used during World War I and was employed extensively during the first half of World War II. After radar detection systems were developed, aircraft camouflage became less important to the Allies, and a number of late-war Allied aircraft were brought to battle with no camouflage. Subsequent camouflage schemes, when used, concentrated on hiding the aircraft from aerial observation while it was resting on or flying near the ground, or they used a light, neutral color to inhibit detection while in the air. Modern camouflage schemes have experimented with light-emitting active camouflage systems which seek to conceal the aircraft from human vision or to blur or confuse optical observation by electronic means.[6]

The Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, commonly referred to as the L-1011 (pronounced "L-ten-eleven") or TriStar, is a medium-to-long-range, wide-body trijet airliner. It was the third widebody airliner to enter commercial operations, after the Boeing 747 and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10. The aircraft has a seating capacity of up to 400 passengers and a range of over 4,000 nautical miles (7,410 km). Its trijet configuration places one Rolls-Royce RB211 engine under each wing, with a third, center-mounted RB211 engine with an S-duct air inlet embedded in the tail and the upper fuselage. The aircraft has an autoland capability, an automated descent control system, and available lower deck galley and lounge facilities.

The L-1011 TriStar was produced in two fuselage lengths. The original L-1011-1 first flew in November 1970, and entered service with Eastern Air Lines in 1972. The shortened, long-range L-1011-500 first flew in 1978, and entered service with British Airways a year later. The original length TriStar was also produced as the high gross weight L-1011-100, uprated engine L-1011-200, and further upgraded L-1011-250. Post-production conversions for the L-1011-1 with increased takeoff weights included the L-1011-50 and L-1011-150.

Between 1968 and 1984, Lockheed manufactured a total of 250 TriStars. They were assembled at the Lockheed plant located at the Palmdale Regional Airport in southern California north of Los Angeles. The aircraft's sales were hampered by two years of delays due to developmental and financial problems at Rolls-Royce, the sole manufacturer of the TriStar's engines. After production ended, Lockheed withdrew from the commercial aircraft business due to its below-target sales.[1]

In the 1960s, American Airlines approached Lockheed and competitor Douglas (later McDonnell Douglas) with the need for an airliner smaller than the 747 capable of carrying a large passenger load to distant locales such as London and Latin America from company hubs at Dallas/Ft Worth and New York. Lockheed had been largely absent from the civil airliner market since the late 1950s following problems with the L-188 Electra, which suffered a number of crashes early in its career.[2][3][4] Having experienced difficulties with some of their military programs, Lockheed was eager to re-enter the civil market, and their response was the L-1011 TriStar. The aircraft was originally conceived as a "jumbo twin", but a three-engine design was ultimately chosen to give the aircraft enough thrust to take off from existing runways.[5]

The design featured a twin-aisle interior with a maximum of 400 passengers, a three-engine layout, low noise emissions (in the early 1970s, Eastern Air Lines nicknamed the L-1011 "WhisperLiner"), improved reliability and efficient operation. The main visible difference between the TriStar and its similar trijet competitor, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, is the middle/tail engine: the DC-10's engine is mounted above the fuselage for simplicity of design and more economical construction, while the TriStar's engine is mounted to the rear fuselage and fed through an S-duct (similar to the Boeing 727) for reduced drag, improved stability, and easier replacement.[6] A further major difference between the L-1011 and the DC-10 was Lockheed's selection of the Rolls-Royce RB211 as the only engine for the L-1011.[7][8] As originally designed, the RB211 turbofan was an advanced three-spool design with a carbon fibre fan,[9] which would have better efficiency and power-to-weight ratio than any competing design. This would make the L-1011 more efficient, a major selling point.


Prototype TriStar preparing for its first flight test in 1970
American Airlines opted for the Douglas DC-10, although they showed considerable interest in the L-1011. American's intent was to convince Douglas to lower their price for the DC-10, which they did.[10] Without the support of American, the TriStar was launched on orders from TWA and Eastern Air Lines. Although the TriStar's design schedule closely followed that of its competitor, Douglas beat Lockheed to market by a year due to delays in powerplant development.

In February 1971, after massive development costs associated with the RB211, Rolls-Royce went into receivership.[11][12] This halted L-1011 final assembly and Lockheed investigated the possibility of a US engine supplier;[13] by then it was considered too late to change engine suppliers. One option presented was potential outsource of RB-211 production to Canadian manufacturer Orenda Engines.[14]

The British government agreed to approve a large state subsidy to restart Rolls-Royce operations on condition the U.S. government guarantee the bank loans Lockheed needed to complete the L-1011 project.[Note 1] Despite some opposition, not least from the then Governor of California Ronald Reagan, the U.S. government provided these guarantees.[16] For the rest of the RB211 project, Rolls-Royce remained a government-owned company.[17]

The TriStar's internal Lockheed model number is L-093. The prototype first flew on November 17, 1970.[18] The crew for that flight was H. B. Dees (pilot), Ralph C. Cokely (copilot), and G.E. Fisher (development engineer). The L-1011 was certified on April 14, 1972 with the first airliner delivered to Eastern Air Lines on April 26, 1972.[18] In an effort to further publicize the new aircraft, an L-1011 was taken on a world tour during 1972 by famed Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier.


An L-1011-1 of Pacific Southwest Airlines at Lockheed's Palmdale plant
Manufactured in Lockheed facilities in Burbank and Palmdale, California, the TriStar faced direct competition from the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, which it closely resembled. Trans World Airlines heralded the TriStar as one of the safest aircraft in the world in promotional literature in the 1980s when concern over the safety record of the DC-10, flown by rival airlines, was at its peak.[18] Five L-1011s have been involved in fatal accidents, only one of which was due to a problem with the aircraft.[19]

Lockheed discovered fairly early on that the TriStar suffered from higher than estimated structural weight, engine weight and specific fuel consumption. To rectify this problem and to meet performance guarantees, Lockheed developed a structural kit that allowed MTOW to be increased on production aircraft from 409,000 to 430,000 pounds (186,000 to 195,000 kg). However, the weight problems affected the weight and desirability of early production L-1011-1 aircraft, known as Group 1 (msn 1002 through to 1012).


The L-1011 TriStar's three-crew flight deck
Group 1 aircraft have on OEW of 252,700 pounds (114,600 kg), about 12,700 pounds (5,800 kg) higher than later aircraft, while Group 2 aircraft (msn 1013 through 1051) have an OEW of 247,000 pounds (112,000 kg), some 4,700 pounds (2,100 kg) lower. These aircraft, in general, also have different center of gravity envelopes with the forward center of gravity limit on the early aircraft being more restrictive at higher gross weights. Group 1 and Group 2 aircraft (msn 1002 to 1051) are upgradeable only to -50 or -150 specifications, although the Group 1 aircraft (up to msn 1012) still maintain their operating disadvantages. L-1011-1 from msn 1052 onwards are Group 3 aircraft and are fully upgradeable to all variants up to -250 specification.

Lockheed needed to sell 500 airliners to break even, but in 1981 the company announced production would end with delivery of the 250th and last L-1011 on order in 1984.[20][21] A total of 250 TriStars were sold compared to 446 DC-10s, partly because of the TriStar's delayed introduction but particularly because a larger version with a longer range was not initially offered. Under state control, costs at Rolls-Royce were tightly controlled. The company's efforts largely went into the original TriStar engines, which needed considerable modifications between the L-1011's first flight and service entry. The competition, notably General Electric, were very quick to develop their CF6 engine with more thrust, which meant that a heavier "intercontinental" DC-10-30 could be more quickly brought to market. The flexibility afforded to potential customers by a long-range DC-10 put the L-1011 at a serious disadvantage. Rolls-Royce went on to develop the high-thrust RB211-524 for the L-1011-200 and -500, but this took many years.[22] The TriStar's failure to achieve profitability caused Lockheed to withdraw from the civil aircraft business.[1]

The L-1011 featured a highly advanced autopilot system and was the first widebody to receive FAA certification for Cat-IIIc autolanding, which approved the TriStar for completely blind landings in zero-visibility weather performed by the aircraft's autopilot.[23] The L-1011 used an Inertial Navigation System (INS) to navigate;[24][25] this included aligning the navigation system by entering current coordinates of longitude and latitude.

It also had a unique Direct Lift Control (DLC) system, which allowed for smooth approaches when landing, without having to use significant pitch changes while on the approach path.[26][27] DLC helps maintain the descending glideslope on final approach by automatically deploying spoiler panels on the wings. Thus, rather than maintaining the descent by adjusting pitch, DLC helps control the descent while maintaining a more consistent pitch angle, using four redundant hydraulic systems. Production also utilized a unique "autoclave" system for bonding fuselage panels together; this made the L-1011 extremely resistant to corrosion.

The earlier versions of the L-1011, such as the -1, -100, and -150 can be distinguished from the later models by the design of the middle engine nacelles. The earlier version nacelle has a round intake, whereas the later models have a small vertical fin between the bottom of the middle engine intake and the top of the fuselage.

The two L-1011 aircraft delivered to Pacific Southwest Airlines were configured with internal airstair doors that led into an entry hall in what was normally the forward lower baggage hold. This was to allow operations from airfields that did not have terminal buildings with jet bridges. These two aircraft were later in service with Aeroperú and Worldways Canada.

In an effort to secure the Japanese market, Lockheed secretly bribed several members of the Japanese government to subsidize ANA's purchase of L-1011s; this caused a significant scandal when the bribes were uncovered.[28][29] The discovered scale to what has become known as the Lockheed bribery scandal led to the arrest of Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka as well as several other officials.[30] Within Lockheed, board chairman Daniel Haughton and vice chairman and president Carl Kotchian resigned their posts on February 13, 1976.[31] Tanaka was eventually tried and found guilty of violating foreign exchange control laws, but was not charged with bribery, a more serious criminal offense.[32][33] Crucially for Lockheed, the fallout from the scandal included the loss of a contract worth in excess of $1 billion.[34]

The Soviet Union at that time lacked a widebody airliner. Development of their own Ilyushin Il-86 was delayed;[35][36] consequently, in the mid-1970s, the Soviets started negotiations to buy 30 TriStars and licence-produce up to 100 a year.[37][38] The talks collapsed as US President Jimmy Carter made human rights a US policy factor.[39][40] The TriStar was also listed by the Coordinating Committee as embodying advanced technology banned from potential enemies, thus being a serious obstacle to the export deal.

Delta Air Lines was the type's largest customer.[41] Delta Air Lines retired its TriStars in 2001 to replace them with the Boeing 767-400ER. Cathay Pacific eventually became the largest non-U.S. operator of the type by acquiring many of the Eastern Air Lines examples when Eastern went bankrupt, operating as many as 21 aircraft. Cathay Pacific retired its L-1011s in October 1996, and replaced the type with the Airbus A330-300. TWA withdrew its last TriStar from service in 1997.

The L-1011 has seen recent use by smaller start-up carriers, particularly in Africa and Asia. These operators mainly do their business in the ad hoc charter and wet leasing businesses. ATA Airlines (formerly known as American Trans Air) fleet included over 19 Tristars, but operations dwindled to only three L1011-500s prior to the company's shutdown in April 2008.


Orbital Sciences' L-1011-100 "Stargazer" releases Pegasus rocket.
In the early 1990s, Orbital Sciences began to use a converted L-1011-100 named Stargazer to launch Pegasus rockets into orbit around Earth. This venture effectively rendered the small Scout rocket obsolete.[42][43] This aircraft was also used in support of the X-34 and X-43 programs. NASA performed aerodynamic research on Orbital Sciences' L-1011 in 1995.[44] As of 2014, three L-1011 in the world are airworthy, and the Stargazer is the only one in the US.[45]

Main article: Lockheed TriStar (RAF)
The TriStar has also been used as a military tanker and passenger/cargo aircraft. The Royal Air Force had nine aircraft of four variants. The aircraft were six ex-British Airways and three Pan Am L-1011-500s.[46][47][48] All of the aircraft served with No. 216 Squadron, and were based at RAF Brize Norton. The Tristar was replaced in RAF service by the Airbus A330 MRTT under the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) program.[49] 216 Squadron was officially disbanded on 20 March 2014 and flew its last sorties with the TriStar on 24 March 2014.[50]

A Thai Sky Airlines L-1011-1 at Hong Kong International Airport in 2005.
The L-1011-1 (FAA certification L-1011-385-1) was the first production model of the L-1011, designed for short and medium-range flights. This variant served as the basis for subsequent variants. This type was purchased by Air Canada, ANA, Cathay Pacific, Eastern and other operators with regional trunk routes requiring a widebody aircraft. Pacific Southwest Airlines purchased two L-1011-1 models with lower deck seating.[51] This variant was also one of the few widebodies to have the option for a full-height built-in airstair.[18]

The L-1011-1 was first delivered to Eastern Air Lines on April 5, 1972. A total of 160 L-1011-1 TriStars were built before production ended in 1983, although the majority of these, 119 or 75% of the total, were completed during a four-year period between 1972 and 1975. Most sales of the L-1011-1 were to US operators, with just three airlines, Delta, Eastern, and TWA, taking delivery of 110 combined. A further two aircraft were placed with a fourth US airline, Pacific Southwest Airlines.[18]


Trans World Airlines L-1011-100 TriStar
The L-1011-100 (FAA certification L-1011-385-1-15) was the second production model of the L-1011 and first flew in 1975 and featured a new center fuel tank and higher gross weights that increased the aircraft's range by nearly 930 miles (1,500 km). Launch orders for the L-1011-100 were placed by Saudia and Cathay Pacific, for two each, in May 1974. First deliveries took place in June 1975.

The variant was also purchased by several airlines with longer-range routes, such as TWA, Air Canada and BEA (which merged with BOAC to form British Airways). The first two L-1011-100s (msn 1110 and 1116) were delivered new to Saudia with the same fuel capacity as the L-1011-1 (FAA certification L-1011-385-1-14), these were later upgraded to L-1011-200 specification.

The L-1011-50 was an upgraded version of the L-1011-1 with an increase in maximum takeoff weight from 430,000 pounds (200,000 kg) to either 440,000 pounds (200,000 kg) or 450,000 pounds (200,000 kg). Fuel capacity was not increased. The -50 was available only as a conversion package for the L-1011-1 and was never built new.


L-1011-150 TriStar of Air Transat (Canada) in 1995
The L-1011-150 was a development of the L-1011-1 with maximum takeoff weight increased to 470,000 pounds (210,000 kg). It was available only as a conversion for the L-1011-1. The -150 involves the conversion of Group 1 and Group 2 L-1011-1 aircraft to an MTOW of 470,000 pounds (210,000 kg), an increase of 40,000 pounds (18,000 kg), about 10%, from the L-1011-1, giving the aircraft a slightly better range than the -50 but, without the additional center section fuel tank, less than the L-1011-100 aircraft. The first aircraft was converted by MBB at Lemwarder in Germany during the winter of 1988/89 and was subsequently handed over to Air Transat of Canada on May 11, 1989.

The L-1011-200 (FAA certification L-1011-385-1-15) was the third production model of the L-1011 and was introduced in 1976. Although otherwise similar to the -100, the -200 uses Rolls-Royce RB.211-524B engines to improve its performance in hot and high-altitude conditions. Gulf Air used -200 models to replace its earlier generation Vickers VC-10 fleet.


A Saudia L-1011-200 at London Heathrow Airport in 1985
Other than the engines, the basic TriStar -200 is identical to the -100, with center section fuel, having a MTOW of 466,000 pounds (211,000 kg), and fuel capacity of 26,400 US gallons (100,000 l) as the -100. An increase of gross weight to 474,000 pounds (215,000 kg) is possible, with the heavier aircraft offered by Lockheed as -200I or -200(Improved). Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) was a launch customer for the -200 series and operated a sizable fleet until 1998. A total of 24 L-1011-200 aircraft were built new, with the first delivered to Saudia on May 28, 1977. Like other TriStar improvements, a conversion program has also been offered.

The L-1011-250 was an upgrade developed for late-model L-1011-1 aircraft and all L-1011-100 and L-1011-200 aircraft. It increased maximum takeoff weight to 510,000 pounds (230,000 kg) and fuel capacity from 23,600 US gal (89,335 l) to 31,632 US gal (119,735 l). This variant also used the upgraded RB211-524B4I engine, which could be easily upgraded on the existing RB211-524B powerplants of the L-1011-200 but required a re-engining on the L-1011-1 and L-1011-100, which used the original RB211-22B. The upgrade allowed the L-1011 to match the performance of the long-range McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30. Although it was applicable to all L-1011 models, it was only used by Delta Air Lines on six late-model L-1011-1 aircraft.


A TAP Air Portugal L-1011-500 at Lisbon Portela Airport in 1988.
The L-1011-500 (FAA certification L-1011-385-3) was the last L-1011 variant to enter production. The L-1011-500 was a longer-range variant first flight tested in 1978. Its fuselage length was shortened by 14 feet (4.3 m) and maximum take-off weight increased to allow higher fuel loads.[citation needed] It also uses the more powerful engines of the -200 series. The -500 variant was popular among international operators and formed a significant portion of the L-1011 fleet of Delta and British Airways. However, its late introduction resulted in many potential customers buying the DC-10-30 instead.

The TriStar 500 first flew on October 16, 1978 with the first delivery to British Airways on April 27, 1979. It entered service with British Airways on May 7, 1979 flying between London and Abu Dhabi.

The TriStar 500 has an overall length of 164 feet 2 inches (50.04 m) and wingspan increased to 164 feet 4 inches (50.09 m) (early TriStar versions originally had the TriStar 1 wing with a span of 155 feet 4 inches (47.35 m)).

Lockheed developed some aerodynamic improvements for the TriStar 500 which included a modified wing to body fairing, a fillet below the central intake, extended wingtips and "active ailerons" or active control system (ACS). The new fairing reduced drag while the fillet reduced noise in the rear cabin. The wingtip extensions increased aspect ratio thus reducing induced drag but would have resulted in increased bending. The ACS, developed to solve this, provided gust alleviation, improving ride during flight, reduced fuel burn and increased fatigue life.


An ATA L-1011-500 landing at Frankfurt, 2005
Earlier TriStar 500s were delivered with the standard wing; these were later retrofitted with ailerons and extended wingtips. Pan Am was the first customer to order the -500 with the extended wingtips and active ailerons. Msn 1176, the first for Pan Am, was the first TriStar 500 to be fitted with them as standard.

The TriStar 500 is equipped with the more powerful RB211-524B engines. Initially rated at 50,000 lbf (220 kN) thrust each, the higher thrust 53,000 lbf (240 kN) -524B4 Improved (also referred to as the -524B4I) later became available, which also offered improved fuel efficiency.

Originally certified with an MTOW of 496,000 pounds (225,000 kg), an increased MTOW of 504,000 pounds (229,000 kg) was later certified in 1979 and all earlier production aircraft were certified at this weight. A further increase, to 510,000 pounds (230,000 kg) is also available and it is understood that most TriStar 500s have had this increase. Standard fuel capacity is 31,600 US gallons (120,000 l), giving the TriStar 500 a range of about 5,200 nautical miles (9,600 km) with 246 passengers and baggage.

The TriStar 500's maximum passenger capacity is 315 although no aircraft were operated at this density. The aircraft is equipped with six (6) exits, two fewer than the long body TriStars, thus reducing the exit limit maximum. A typical two-class layout might include 21 first and 229 economy for a maximum of 250 passengers. More spacious three-class layouts used on longer routes include 233 with 12 first, 32 business, and 189 economy with Delta Air Lines.

A British Airtours TriStar overran the runway at Leeds Bradford International Airport in 1985.
As of December 2011, the L-1011 was involved in 32 aviation occurrences,[63] including 11 hull-loss accidents,[64] with 539 fatalities.[65]

Of the four pioneering wide-body aircraft (Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, L-1011 and Airbus A300/A310 family), the Lockheed L-1011 had comparatively few accidents and a better safety record than its competitors.[66][67][68]

In 1972, Eastern Air Lines Flight 401, an L-1011, crashed in the Florida Everglades as a result of the flight crew's failure to monitor the flight instruments during a malfunction of the landing gear position indicator system. The crash resulted in 101 fatalities, and was the subject of two TV movies, Crash and The Ghost of Flight 401. It was also the subject of a Mayday episode.[69][70]
On August 19, 1980, a fire destroyed the L-1011-200 used for Saudia Flight 163 on the ground after the pilots made an emergency landing at Riyadh's International Airport due to fire in the rear of the aircraft. Delays in initiating the evacuation of the aircraft led to the deaths of all 287 passengers and 14 crew.[71][72]
On December 23, 1980, Saudia Flight 162, an L-1011, had a tire explode and penetrate the passenger cabin. The aircraft lost cabin pressure and two passengers fell out of the aircraft.[73]
On September 22, 1981, Eastern Airlines Flight 935 departed Newark, New Jersey and suffered an uncontained failure of its number two (tail) engine at 14,500 feet (4,400 m), while en route to San Juan, Puerto Rico.[74][75] The fragments from that engine damaged three of its four hydraulic systems resulting in fluid loss in them. The rudder pedals also jammed. The fragments struck but did not puncture the lines for the other hydraulic system; the captain was able to safely land the aircraft at John F. Kennedy International Airport, with some limited use of the outboard spoilers, the inboard ailerons and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries. The L-1011 having four hydraulic systems (instead of three like the DC-10) allowed for a safe landing.[76][77]
On May 5, 1983, Eastern Air Lines Flight 855, L-1011 registration N334EA, while flying from Miami to Nassau, shut down the #2 engine due to low oil pressure and began a return to Miami. Both of the remaining engines later failed. Without power, flight 855 descended from 13,000 to 4,000 feet (1,200 m) before the #2 engine was restarted and the aircraft landed in Miami without injuries. Incorrect engine maintenance had led to the loss of oil on all three engines.[78]
On August 2, 1985, Delta Air Lines Flight 191, an L-1011, crashed while approaching Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in micro burst conditions. The crash killed eight of 11 crew members and 128 of the 152 passengers on board as well as one person on the ground.[79][80]
On October 18, 1985, a Jordanian Airlines L-1011 experienced an inflight fire at 24,000 feet while on approach to Singapore. The fire burned though the rear pressure bulkhead, causing explosive depressurization of the cabin. The air rushing out of the cabin extinguished the fire, saving the aircraft.[81]
On May 3, 1986, Air Lanka Flight 512, an L-1011, was destroyed on the ground in Colombo, Sri Lanka, after a bomb exploded in the rear cargo hold severing the tail and killing 21 people.[82]
On July 30, 1992, TWA Flight 843, an L-1011, had its takeoff aborted by the captain after liftoff from JFK, in response to a false stall warning. The aircraft landed too hard, breaking a wing spar and starting a fire. All 292 passengers and crew evacuated safely, with only 10 minor injuries. The airliner was destroyed by fire.[83]
The forward upper fuselage of the prototype aircraft, N1011, is preserved at the Delta Flight Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, painted in Delta colors.
Tristar 50 N700TS is on display at the National Airline History Museum in Kansas City.[84]
TriStar 200 HZ-AHP of Saudia is on display at the Royal Saudi Air Force Museum in Riyadh.

MiG-105

MiG 105-11 test vehicle at the Monino Air Force museum.[1]
Role	Test vehicle
Manufacturer	Mikoyan-Gurevich
First flight	1976
Status	Cancelled
Primary user	Soviet Air Force
The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105 part of a program known as the Spiral (aerospace system) was a manned test vehicle to explore low-speed handling and landing.[2] It was a visible result of a Soviet project to create an orbital spaceplane. This was originally conceived in response to the American Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar military space project and may have been influenced by contemporary manned lifting body research being conducted by NASA's Flight Research Center in California. The MiG 105 was nicknamed "Lapot" Russian: лапоть, or bast shoe (the word is also used as a slang for "shoe") for the shape of its nose.

The program was also known as EPOS (Russian acronym for Experimental Passenger Orbital Aircraft). Work on this project finally began in 1965, two years after Dyna-Soar's cancellation. The project was halted in 1969, to be briefly resurrected in 1974 in response to the U.S. Space Shuttle Program. The test vehicle made its first subsonic free-flight test in 1976, taking off under its own power from an old airstrip near Moscow. It was flown by pilot Aviard G. Fastovets to the Zhukovskii flight test center, a distance of 19 miles. Flight tests, totaling eight in all, continued sporadically until 1978. The actual space plane project was cancelled when the decision was made to instead proceed with the Buran project. The MiG test vehicle itself still exists and is currently on display at the Monino Air Force Museum in Russia.

Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy was the leader of the Spiral development programme.

Although having basically the same mission, Dyna-Soar and Spiral were radically different vehicles. For example:[citation needed]

While the X-20 Dyna-Soar was designed for launch atop a conventional expendable rocket such as the Titan III-C or Saturn I, Soviet engineers opted for a midair launch scheme for Spiral. Known as "50 / 50", the idea was that the spaceplane and a liquid fuel booster stage would be launched at high altitude from the back of a large, airbreathing mothership travelling at hypersonic speeds. The mothership was to have been built by the Tupolev Design Bureau (OKB-156) and utilize many of the same technologies developed for the Tu-144 supersonic transport and the Sukhoi T-4 Mach 3 bomber. It was never built.
Dyna-Soar was designed as a lifting body, while Spiral was a conventional delta that featured an innovative variable-dihedral wing. During launch and reentry, these were folded upward at 60 degrees. After dropping to subsonic speeds post-reentry, the pilot lowered the wings into the horizontal position, giving the spaceplane better re-entry and flight characteristics.
Spiral was built to allow for a powered landing and go-around maneuver in case of a missed landing approach. An air intake for a single Kolesov turbojet was mounted beneath the central vertical stabilizer. This was protected during launch and re-entry by a clamshell door which opened at subsonic speeds. By comparison, Dyna-Soar was designed primarily for a once-off, unpowered deadstick landing.
High temperature superalloy metals such as niobium, molybdenum, tungsten and rene 41 were to have been used in the heatshield structure of the X-20. Spiral was to have been protected by what Soviet engineers termed "scale-plate armour": steel plates mounted on articulated ceramic bearings to allow for thermal expansion during reentry. Several BOR (Russian acronym for Unpiloted Orbital Rocketplane) craft were flown to test this concept.
In the event of a booster explosion or in-flight emergency, the crew compartment of Spiral was designed to separate from the rest of the vehicle and parachute to earth like a conventional ballistic capsule; this could be done at any point in the flight. Such an escape crew capsule was also considered for Dyna-Soar, but American engineers eventually opted for a solid-fuel escape rocket that would kick the spaceplane away from an exploding booster, hopefully saving both pilot and spacecraft.
Much like the Space Shuttle, Dyna-Soar was designed with a small payload bay behind the pressurized crew module. This could be used for lofting small satellites, carrying surveillance equipment, weapons or even an extra crewmember in a pop-in cockpit. Spiral, on the other hand, was intended to carry only its pilot.
Both Dyna-Soar and Spiral were designed to land on skids. The landing skids on Dyna-Soar were designed to deploy from insulated doors on the underside of the vehicle, like a conventional aircraft. Soviet engineers designed the landing skids on Spiral to deploy from a set of doors on the sides of the fuselage just above and ahead of the wings.

Gherman Titov, the second cosmonaut and the main test pilot of the MiG-105.
A cosmonaut training group for pilots assigned to fly this vehicle was formed in the early 1960s. It went through many changes and was eventually dissolved entirely. Known members included:

Gherman Titov, the second man to orbit the Earth (see Vostok 2 mission).
Vasily Lazarev, Cosmonaut who would later fly the first Soyuz 7K-T mission (see Soyuz 12)
Aviard G. Fastovets, who piloted the vehicle during the majority of its atmospheric tests.
The БОР (Russian: Беспилотный Орбитальный Ракетоплан, Bespilotnyi Orbital'nyi Raketoplan, "Unpiloted Orbital Rocketplane"). Another spacecraft to use the Spiral design was the BOR series, unmanned subscale reentry test vehicles. American analogs X-23 PRIME and ASSET. Several of these craft have been preserved in aerospace museums around the world.

Flight attendant, circa 1949–1950, American Overseas Airlines, Flagship Denmark, Boeing 377 Stratocruiser
The role of a flight attendant derives from that of similar positions on passenger ships or passenger trains, but it has more direct involvement with passengers because of the confined quarters on aircraft. Additionally, the job of a flight attendant revolves around safety to a much greater extent than those of similar staff on other forms of transportation. Flight attendants on board a flight collectively form a cabin crew, as distinguished from pilots and engineers in the cockpit.

Heinrich Kubis was the world's first flight attendant, in 1912.[3]

Origins of the word "steward" in transportation are reflected in the term "chief steward" as used in maritime transport terminology. The term purser and chief steward are often used interchangeably describing personnel with similar duties among seafaring occupations. This lingual derivation results from the international British maritime tradition (i.e. chief mate) dating back to the 14th century and the civilian United States Merchant Marine on which US aviation is somewhat modeled. Due to international conventions and agreements, in which all ships' personnel who sail internationally are similarly documented by their respective countries, the U.S. Merchant Marine assigns such duties to the chief steward in the overall rank and command structure of which pursers are not positionally represented or rostered.

Imperial Airways of the United Kingdom had "cabin boys" or "stewards"; in the 1920s. In the US, Stout Airways was the first to employ stewards in 1926, working on Ford Trimotor planes between Detroit and Grand Rapids, Michigan. Western Airlines (1928) and Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) (1929) were the first US carriers to employ stewards to serve food. Ten-passenger Fokker aircraft used in the Caribbean had stewards in the era of gambling trips to Havana, Cuba from Key West, Florida. Lead flight attendants would in many instances also perform the role of purser, steward, or chief steward in modern aviation terminology.

The first female flight attendant was a 25-year-old registered nurse named Ellen Church.[4] Hired by United Airlines in 1930,[5] she also first envisioned nurses on aircraft. Other airlines followed suit, hiring nurses to serve as flight attendants, then called "stewardesses" or "air hostesses", on most of their flights. In the United States, the job was one of only a few in the 1930s to permit women, which, coupled with the Great Depression, led to large numbers of applicants for the few positions available. Two thousand women applied for just 43 positions offered by Transcontinental and Western Airlines in December 1935.[6]

Female flight attendants rapidly replaced male ones, and by 1936, they had all but taken over the role.[5] They were selected not only for their knowledge but also for their characteristics. A 1936 New York Times article described the requirements:

The girls who qualify for hostesses must be petite; weight 100 to 118 pounds; height 5 feet to 5 feet 4 inches; age 20 to 26 years. Add to that the rigid physical examination each must undergo four times every year, and you are assured of the bloom that goes with perfect health.[5]

Three decades later, a 1966 New York Times classified ad for stewardesses at Eastern Airlines listed these requirements:

A high school graduate, single (widows and divorcees with no children considered), 20 years of age (girls 19 1/2 may apply for future consideration). 5'2" but no more than 5'9", weight 105 to 135 in proportion to height and have at least 20/40 vision without glasses.[7]

In the United States, they were required to be unmarried and were fired if they decided to wed.[6] The requirement to be a registered nurse on an American airline was relaxed as more women were hired,[6] and it disappeared almost entirely during World War II as many nurses enlisted in the armed forces.[citation needed]

Ruth Carol Taylor was the first African-American flight attendant in the United States.[8] Hired in December 1957,[9] on February 11, 1958, Taylor was the flight attendant on a Mohawk Airlines flight from Ithaca to New York, the first time such a position had been held by an African American.[10] She was let go within six months as a result of Mohawk's then-common marriage ban.[11]

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's first complainants were female flight attendants complaining of age discrimination, weight requirements, and bans on marriage.[12] (Originally female flight attendants were fired if they reached age 32 or 35 depending on the airline, were fired if they exceeded weight regulations, and were required to be single upon hiring and fired if they got married.[13]) In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants’ employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[14] Also in 1968, the EEOC ruled that sex was not a bona fide occupational requirement to be a flight attendant.[15] The restriction of hiring only women was lifted at all airlines in 1971 due to the decisive court case of Diaz vs. Pan Am.[16] The no-marriage rule was eliminated throughout the US airline industry by the 1980s.[17] The last such broad categorical discrimination, the weight restrictions,[18] were relaxed in the 1990s through litigation and negotiations.[19] Flight attendants still must usually have weight in proportion to height; persons outside the normal range may not be qualified to act as flight attendants.[20]

The primary role of a flight attendant is to ensure passenger safety. In addition to this, flight attendants are often tasked with customer service duties such as serving meals and drinks, as a secondary responsibility.[21][22]

The number of flight attendants required on flights are mandated by international safety regulations. For planes with up to 19 passenger seats, no flight attendant is needed.[23] For larger planes, one flight attendant per 50 passenger seats is needed.[23]

The majority of flight attendants for most airlines are female, though a substantial number of males have entered the industry since 1980.[24]

An EgyptAir flight attendant performing a pre-flight safety demonstration
Prior to each flight, flight attendants attend a safety briefing with the pilots and lead flight attendant. During this briefing, they go over safety and emergency checklists, the locations and amounts of emergency equipment and other features specific to that aircraft type. Boarding particulars are verified, such as special needs passengers, small children traveling as unaccompanied or VIPs. Weather conditions are discussed including anticipated turbulence. Prior to each flight a safety check is conducted to ensure all equipment such as life-vests, torches (flashlights) and firefighting equipment are on board, in the right quantity, and in proper condition. Any unserviceable or missing items must be reported and rectified prior to takeoff. They must monitor the cabin for any unusual smells or situations. They assist with the loading of carry-on baggage, checking for weight, size and dangerous goods. They make sure those sitting in emergency exit rows are willing and able to assist in an evacuation and move those who are not willing or able out of the row into another seat. They then must do a safety demonstration or monitor passengers as they watch a safety video. They then must "secure the cabin" ensuring tray tables are stowed, seats are in their upright positions, armrests down and carry-ons stowed correctly and seat belts are fastened prior to takeoff. All the service between boarding and take-off is called Pre Take off Service.[21]


Aeroflot flight attendant, June 2013
Once up in the air, flight attendants will usually serve drinks and/or food to passengers. When not performing customer service duties, flight attendants must periodically conduct cabin checks and listen for any unusual noises or situations. Checks must also be done on the lavatory to ensure the smoke detector hasn't been disabled or destroyed and to restock supplies as needed. Regular cockpit checks must be done to ensure the health and safety of the pilot(s). They must also respond to call lights dealing with special requests. During turbulence, flight attendants must ensure the cabin is secure. Prior to landing, all loose items, trays and rubbish must be collected and secured along with service and galley equipment. All hot liquids must be disposed of. A final cabin check must then be completed prior to landing. It is vital that flight attendants remain aware as the majority of emergencies occur during takeoff and landing.[citation needed] Upon landing, flight attendants must remain stationed at exits and monitor the airplane and cabin as passengers disembark the plane. They also assist any special needs passengers and small children off the airplane and escort children, while following the proper paperwork and ID process to escort them to the designated person picking them up.

Flight attendants are trained to deal with a wide variety of emergencies, and are trained in First Aid. More frequent situations may include a bleeding nose, illness, small injuries, intoxicated passengers, aggressive and anxiety stricken passengers. Emergency training includes rejected takeoffs, emergency landings, cardiac and in-flight medical situations, smoke in the cabin, fires, depressurization, on-board births and deaths, dangerous goods and spills in the cabin, emergency evacuations, hijackings, and water landings.[citation needed]




Flight attendants for Germanwings performing in flight service duties
On most commercial airliners, flight attendants receive various forms of notification on board the aircraft in the form of audible chimes and colored lights above their stations. Typically, the following chimes and colors are used:

Pink or Red - Interphone calls from the cockpit to a flight attendant and/or interphone calls between two flight attendants (steady with high-low chime), or all services emergency call (flashing with repeated high-low chime).
Blue - Call from passenger in seat (steady with single high chime).
Amber - Call from passenger in lavatory (steady with single high chime), or lavatory smoke detector set off (flashing with repeated high chime).
Green (non-standard) - On some airlines' Airbus aircraft, this color is used to indicate interphone calls between two flight attendants, distinguishing them from the pink or red light used for interphone calls made from the cockpit to a flight attendant, and is also accompanied with a high-low chime like the pink or red light. On some other airlines' aircraft, this color has a completely different meaning, and is used to indicate that the cockpit is no longer sterile after the aircraft is above a specific altitude.
The Chief Purser (CP), also titled as Inflight Service Manager (ISM), Flight Service Manager (FSM), Customer Service Manager (CSM) or Cabin Service Director (CSD) is the senior flight attendant in the chain of command of flight attendants. While not necessarily the most senior crew members on a flight (in years of service to their respective carrier), Chief Pursers can have varying levels of "in-flight" or "on board" bidding seniority or tenure in relation to their flying partners. To reach this position, a crew member requires some minimum years of service as flight attendant. Further training is mandatory, and Chief Pursers typically earn a higher salary than flight attendants because of the added responsibility and managerial role.

The Purser is in charge of the cabin crew, in a specific section of a larger aircraft, or the whole aircraft itself (if the purser is the highest ranking). On board a larger aircraft, Pursers assist the Chief Purser in managing the cabin. Pursers are flight attendants or a related job, typically with an airline for several years prior to application for, and further training to become a purser, and normally earn a higher salary than flight attendants because of the added responsibility and supervisory role.

Flight attendants are normally trained in the hub or headquarters city of an airline over a period that may run from four weeks to six months, depending on the country and airline. The main focus of training is safety, and attendants will be checked out for each type of aircraft in which they work. One of the most elaborate training facilities was Breech Academy which Trans World Airlines (TWA) opened in 1969 in Overland Park, Kansas. Other airlines were to also send their attendants to the school. However, during the fare wars, the school's viability declined and it closed around 1988.

Safety training includes, but is not limited to: emergency passenger evacuation management, use of evacuation slides/life rafts, in-flight firefighting, first aid, CPR, defibrillation, ditching/emergency landing procedures, decompression emergencies, crew resource management, and security.

In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration requires flight attendants on aircraft with 20 or more seats and used by an air carrier for transportation to hold a Certificate of Demonstrated Proficiency. This is not considered to be the equivalent of an airman certificate (license), although it is issued on the same card stock. It shows that a level of required training has been met. It is not limited to the air carrier at which the attendant is employed (although some initial documents showed the airlines where the holders were working), and is the attendant's personal property. It does have two ratings, Group 1 and Group 2 (listed on the certificate as "Group I" and "Group II"). Either or both of these may be earned depending upon the general type of aircraft, (propeller or turbojet), on which the holder has trained.[25]

There are also training schools, not affiliated with any particular airline, where students generally not only undergo generic, though otherwise practically identical, training to flight attendants employed by an airline, but also take curriculum modules to help them gain employment. These schools often use actual airline equipment for their lessons, though some are equipped with full simulator cabins capable of replicating a number of emergency situations. In some countries, such as France, a degree is required, together with the Certificat de Formation à la Sécurité (safety training certificate).[26]

Multilingual flight attendants are often in demand to accommodate international travellers. The languages most in demand, other than English, are French, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Arabic, Slovak, German, Portuguese, Italian, Turkish[27] and Greek.[citation needed] In the United States, airlines with international routes pay an additional stipend for language skills on top of flight pay, and some airlines hire specifically for certain languages when launching international destinations.

Most airlines have height requirements for safety reasons, making sure that all flight attendants can reach overhead safety equipment. Typically, the acceptable height for this is 150 to 185 cm (4 ft 11 in to 6 ft 1 in) tall.[28] Some airlines, such as EVA Air, have height requirements for purely aesthetic purposes. Regional carriers using small aircraft with low ceilings can have height restrictions.

Flight attendants are also subject to weight requirements as well. Weight must usually be in proportion to height; persons outside the normal range may not be qualified to act as flight attendants.[20]


Garuda Indonesia flight attendants uniform featuring kebaya and batik
The first flight attendant uniforms were designed to be durable, practical, and inspire confidence in passengers. In the 1930s, the first female flight attendants dressed in uniforms resembling nurses' outfits.[29] The first female flight attendants for United Airlines wore green berets, green capes and nurse's shoes. Other airlines, such as Eastern Air Lines, actually dressed female flight attendants in nurses' uniforms.

Perhaps reflecting the military aviation background of many commercial aviation pioneers, many early uniforms had a strongly military appearance; hats, jackets, and skirts showed simple straight lines and military details like epaulettes and brass buttons. Many uniforms had a summer and winter version, differentiated by colours and fabrics appropriate to the season: navy blue for winter, for example, khaki for summer. But as the role of women in the air grew, and airline companies began to realise the publicity value of their female flight attendants, more feminine lines and colours began to appear in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Some airlines began to commission designs from high-end department stores and still others called in noted designers or even milliners to create distinctive and attractive apparel.

Since the 1980s to present, Asian airlines, especially national flag carrier ones, usually feature the traditional dress and fabrics of their respective country in their female flight attendants' uniform. It was meant as a marketing strategy to showcase their national culture as well as to convey the welcoming warmth and hospitality. For example, Thai Airways flight attendants are required to change from their corporate purple suits into traditional Thai costume prior to passengers boarding.[30] While the uniform of Garuda Indonesia female flight attendants is a modified kebaya, inspired by the traditional batik motif of Parang Gondosuli, the motif is called Lereng Garuda Indonesia.[31] Malaysian. Singapore Airlines flight attendants wear batik prints in their uniform. Vietnam Airlines flight attendants wear red áo dài and Air India flight attendants wear a Sari on all passenger flights.

Flight attendants are generally expected to show a high level of personal grooming such as appropriate use of cosmetics and thorough personal hygiene.

Flight attendants must not have any tattoos visible when a uniform is worn. These requirements are designed to give the airlines a positive presentation.

In several airlines in the Islamic World, such as Egypt Air, Iran Air and Saudia, female flight attendants' uniforms have added a hijab to conform to the Islamic customs.


Singapore Girls, featured in Singapore Airlines' advertising
In the 1960s and 1970s, many airlines began advertising the attractiveness and friendliness of their stewardesses. National Airlines began a "Fly Me"; campaign using attractive female flight attendants with taglines such as "I'm Lorraine. Fly me to Orlando." (A low budget 1973 film about three flight attendants, Fly Me, starring Lenore Kasdorf, was based on the ad campaign.) Braniff International Airways, presented a campaign known as the "Air Strip" with similarly attractive young female flight attendant changing uniforms mid-flight.[32] A policy of at least one airline required that only unmarried women could be flight attendants.[33]

Flight attendant Roz Hanby became a minor celebrity when she became the face of British Airways in their "Fly the Flag" advertising campaign over a 7-year period in the 1980s. Singapore Airlines is currently one of the few airlines still choosing to use the image of their female flight attendants, known as Singapore Girls, in their advertising material. However, this is starting to be phased out, in favor of advertising which emphasises the modernity of their fleet.

Flight attendant unions were formed, beginning at United Airlines in the 1940s, to negotiate improvements in pay, benefits and working conditions.[34] Those unions would later challenge what they perceived as sexist stereotypes and unfair work practices such as age limits, size limits, limitations on marriage, and prohibition of pregnancy. Many of these limitations have been lifted by judicial mandates. The largest flight attendants' union is the Association of Flight Attendants, representing nearly 60,000 flight attendants at 19 airlines within the US.[35]

The Association of Professional Flight Attendants[36] represents the flight attendants of American Airlines, the world’s largest carrier. APFA is the largest independent flight attendant union in the world.[37]

In the UK, cabin crew can be represented by either Cabin Crew '89, or the much larger and more powerful Transport and General Workers' Union.

In Australia, flight attendants are represented by the Flight Attendants' Association of Australia (FAAA). There are two divisions: one for international crews (long-haul) and one for domestic crews (short-haul).

In New Zealand, flight attendants can be represented by either the Flight Attendants and Related Services Association (FARSA) or by the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union (EPMU).

In Canada, flight attendants are represented by either the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) or by the Canadian Flight Attendants Union (CFAU).

Originally female flight attendants were required to be single upon hiring, and were fired if they got married, exceeded weight regulations, or reached age 32 or 35 depending on the airline.[13] In the 1970s the group Stewardesses for Women's Rights protested sexist advertising and company discrimination, and brought many cases to court. In 1968, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that sex was not a bona fide occupational requirement to be a flight attendant.[15] The age restriction was eliminated in 1970.[13] The restriction of hiring only women was lifted at all airlines in 1971 due to the decisive court case of Diaz vs. Pan Am.[16] The no-marriage rule was eliminated throughout the US airline industry by the 1980s.[17] The last such broad categorical discrimination, the weight restrictions,[18] were relaxed in the 1990s through litigation and negotiations.[19] Flight attendants still must usually have weight in proportion to height; persons outside the normal range may not be qualified to act as flight attendants.[20] By the end of the 1970s, the term stewardess had generally been replaced by the gender-neutral alternative flight attendant. More recently the term cabin crew or cabin staff has begun to replace 'flight attendants' in some parts of the world, because of the term's recognition of their role as members of the crew.

Actions of flight attendants in emergencies have long been credited in saving lives; in the United States, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and other aviation authorities view flight attendants as essential for safety, and are thus usually required on Part 121 aircraft operations.[38] Studies, some done in light of British Airtours Flight 28M, have concluded that assertive cabin crew are essential for the rapid evacuation of aeroplanes.[39][40] Notable examples of cabin crew actions include:

The role of flight attendants received heightened prominence after the September 11 attacks when flight attendants (such as Sandra W. Bradshaw and CeeCee Lyles of United Airlines Flight 93, Robert Fangman of United Airlines Flight 175, Renee May of American Airlines Flight 77 and Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney of American Airlines Flight 11) actively attempted to protect passengers from assault, and also provided vital information to air traffic controllers on the hijackings.[41]

In the wake of these attacks, many flight attendants at major airlines were laid off because of decreased passenger loads.[41]

In April 1936, flight attendant Nellie Granger aided survivors after the crash of TWA Flight 1, then walked 4 mi (6.4 km) through a snowstorm to find help, before returning to the crash scene.[42][43]
Naila Nazir, Pakistani flight attendant (employee of Pakistan International Airlines) who received 1985's Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) Heroism Award for her brave handling of tense and dangerous situation during 13 days of flight PK-326 hijacking ordeal.[44][45]
British Airtours Flight 28M, the two forward flight attendants, Arthur Bradbury and Joanna Toff, repeatedly crawled into the smoked filled and burning cabin to drag a number of passengers to safety, and were subsequently awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal. The two rear flight attendants, Sharon Ford and Jacqui Ubanski, who opened the rear doors but were overwhelmed by fire and smoke were awarded the same medal posthumously.
Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751, when cabin crew recognised an emergency landing was imminent and commanded the passengers to "bend down ... hold your knees" to adopt the brace position.[46]
Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529, whose sole flight attendant, Robin Fech, provided emergency briefings, brace and evacuation commands to the passengers when the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia aircraft sustained serious damage to one of its engines and crash landed. The NTSB accident report commended "the exemplary manner in which the flight attendant briefed the passengers and handled the emergency".[47]
BOAC Flight 712, where a flight attendant, Barbara Jane Harrison died saving passengers from an on-board fire and was posthumously awarded the George Cross.
British Airways Flight 5390, in which a flight attendant was able to prevent a pilot from being lost through a cockpit window that had failed.
Southern Airways Flight 242, on which the cabin crew provided safety briefings to their passengers, and on their own initiative, warned passengers of the impending crash by commanding passengers to adopt the brace position. At least one flight attendant is known to have assisted in rescuing trapped passengers.[48]
Air Florida Flight 90, in which Kelly Duncan, the lone surviving flight attendant, passed the only lifevest she could find to another passenger. She is recognised in the NTSB report for this "unselfish act."[49]
TWA flight attendant Uli Derickson who protected passengers during the TWA Flight 847 hijacking by assisting with negotiation efforts.
TWA Flight 843, when a TWA Lockheed L-1011 aircraft crashed after an aborted takeoff in 1992. The aircraft was destroyed by fire. Nine flight attendants, along with five off-duty flight attendants, evacuated all 292 persons on board without loss of life. The NTSB in their after accident reported noted, "The performance of the flight attendants during the emergency was exceptional and probably contributed to the success of the emergency evacuation."[50][51]
On British Airways Flight 2069, cabin crew stopped the plane from being crashed by a mentally ill passenger.[52]
Crew on American Airlines Flight 63 prevented shoe bomber Richard Colvin Reid from blowing up the plane.[53]
Flight attendants on Qantas Flight 1737 prevented their plane from being hijacked by a passenger with mental health issues. Two of them were taken to hospital with stab wounds.[54]
Aloha Airlines Flight 243 suffered a decompression which tore an 18-foot (5.5 m) section of fuselage away from the plane. The only fatality was flight attendant C.B. Lansing who was blown out of the airplane. Flight attendant Michelle Honda was thrown violently to the floor during the decompression but, despite her injuries, crawled up and down the aisle reassuring passengers.[55]
Senior Purser Neerja Bhanot saved the lives of passengers and crew when Pan Am Flight 73 was hijacked. She was killed while protecting children from the terrorists. After her death she received the Special Courage Award from the United States Department of Justice and India's highest civilian honor for bravery, the Ashoka Chakra.
Flight Attendants on Air Canada Flight 797 (Sergio Benetti, Judi Davidson, Laura Kayama) used procedures which were not specifically taught in training such as moving passengers to the front of the aircraft to move them away from the fire and smoke, and passing out towels for passengers to cover their nose and mouths with while the cabin was filling with smoke.
Flight Attendants on US Airways Flight 1549 successfully evacuated all passengers from the aircraft within 90 seconds despite the fact that the rear was rapidly filling with water.
Nine cabin crew members aboard Air France Flight 358 successfully evacuated the aircraft within 90 seconds after the A340-300 overran a runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport. The NTSB stated that the actions of the cabin crew contributed to the 100% survival rate.
The flight attendants of Philippine Airlines Flight 434 kept the passengers calm after a bomb exploded during the flight from Cebu to Tokyo. Though one passenger was killed during the explosion, They took care of the injured passengers.

Queen Silvia of Sweden, was briefly a flight attendant before marrying King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
On August 9, 2010, Steven Slater gained immediate global fame when he claimed he was injured by the luggage of a passenger whom he had confronted on an arriving Jet Blue flight at New York's JFK Airport for disregarding his order to remain seated. Passengers dispute his account of this confrontation. As the incident continued, he cursed at the passengers over the aircraft's public address system, grabbed a beer, opened the evacuation slide and left the aircraft. He was later arrested and charged with several crimes.[59][60]

On August 30, 2014, Robert Reardon of Delta Air Lines retired at the age of 90 after having eclipsed Ron Akana of United Airlines as the world's longest serving flight attendant and also having been the world's oldest active flight attendant. Reardon said the timing of his retirement was "not of his choosing."[61]

The Boeing C-137 Stratoliner was a VIP transport aircraft derived from the Boeing 707 jet airliner used by the United States Air Force. Other nations also bought both new and used 707s for military service, primarily as VIP or tanker transports. In addition, the 707 served as the basis for several specialized versions, such as the E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft. The designation C-18 covers several later variants based on the 707-320B/C series.

USAF procurement of the Boeing 707 was very limited, amounting to three Model 707-153s designated VC-137A. When delivered in 1959 these had four 13,500 lb (6123 kg) dry thrust Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 (JT3C6) turbojets; when subsequently re-engined with 18,000 lbf (80.1 kN) dry thrust TF33-P-5 (JT3D) turbofans they were redesignated VC-137B. Only one other variant served with the USAF: this was the VC-137C Air Force One Presidential transport, the two examples of which were Model 707-320B Intercontinentals with specialized interior furnishings and advanced communications equipment. Two further non-presidential C-137C aircraft were later added.[1]

To supplement its VC-137s, the USAF converted several C-135 airframes to VC-135 VIP standard, and these were used for staff transport mainly within the United States.[1]


An EC-18B Advanced Range Instrumentation Aircraft (ARIA) takes off on its first flight at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, following its conversion from a Boeing 707-320.
The C-18 is the US military designation for the conversions of the 707-320B series.

C-18A
Eight second-hand (former American Airlines) 707-323Cs bought as crew trainers for the EC-18Bs, four later converted to EC-18B, two converted to EC-18D, one to C-18B; one was not taken into service and was used for spares.
C-18B
One C-18A modified with instrumentation and equipment to support the Military Strategic and Tactical Relay System (MILSTAR).[2]
EC-18B
Four C-18As modified alongside examples of the C-135 for Advanced Range Instrumentation Aircraft (ARIA) missions in support of the Apollo space program.[2] The designation E-7 was originally applied to modified Boeing 707s before being replaced by the EC-18 designation.[3]
EC-18C
Original designation for two prototype J-STAR aircraft, later redesignated E-8A.
EC-18D
Two C-18As modified as a Cruise Missile Mission Control Aircraft (CMMCA).[2]
TC-18E
Two second-hand (former Trans World Airlines) 707-331 aircraft modified for E-3 pilot and crew training.[2]
TC-18F
Two second-hand (former TAP Portugal) 707-382 aircraft modified for E-6 pilot training.[2]

The USAF purchased a number of 707s under the C-137 series of designations:

VC-137A
Three 707-153s with a 22-passenger VIP interior and provision for use as an airborne command post, re-designated VC-137B.
VC-137B
The three VC-137As re-engined with four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D-3 engines, operated by the 89th Military Airlift Wing, redesignated C-137B.
C-137B
The three VC-137Bs redesignated when downgraded from VIP role.
VC-137C
Two 707-353Bs were purchased by the USAF (one in 1961 and one in 1972) for service as presidential transports with call signs SAM 26000 and SAM 27000; later redesignated C-137C.
C-137C
The two VC-137Cs were redesignated when downgraded from presidential use. Two further C-137Cs were acquired by the USAF, one 707-396C (a seized aircraft formerly used for arms smuggling acquired in 1985) and one 707-382B bought second hand in 1987.
EC-137D
Two aircraft built as Early Warning and Control System prototypes. Later re-engined and re-designated E-3A. A further second-hand 707-355C aircraft was acquired and configured as an airborne special operations command post.
Boeing E-3 Sentry
Airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft that provides all-weather surveillance, command, control and communications, to the United States, NATO and other air defense forces. Based on the 707-320B, production ended in 1992 after 68 had been built.
Boeing E-6 Mercury
A version of the 707-320, it operates as an airborne command post and communications center, relaying instructions from the National Command Authority. Its role in relaying to the fleet ballistic missile submarines, known as "Take Charge and Move Out", gives it the suffix TACAMO (). Only one version of the E-6 currently exists, the E-6B. The E-6B is an upgraded version of the E-6A that now includes a battlestaff area for the USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post
Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS
The E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) is a USAF airborne battle management and command and control (C2) platform that conducts ground surveillance to develop an understanding of the enemy situation and to support attack operations and targeting that contributes to the delay, disruption and destruction of enemy forces.

The Douglas DC-8 (also known as the McDonnell Douglas DC-8) is a four-engine long-range narrow-body jet airliner built from 1958 to 1972 by the Douglas Aircraft Company. Launched after the competing Boeing 707, the DC-8 nevertheless kept Douglas in a strong position in the airliner market, and remained in production until 1972 when it began to be superseded by larger wide-body designs, including the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. The DC-8's design allowed it a slightly larger cargo capacity than the 707 and some re-engined DC-8s are still in use as freighters.

After World War II Douglas had a commanding position in the commercial aircraft market. Boeing had pointed the way to the modern all-metal airliner in 1933 with the 247, but Douglas, more than any other company, made commercial air travel a reality. Douglas produced a succession of piston-engined aircraft (DC-2, DC-3, DC-4, DC-5, DC-6, and DC-7) through the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. When de Havilland flew the first jet airliner, the Comet, in 1949, Douglas felt no need to rush into anything new. Their U.S. competitors at Lockheed and Convair felt the same way: that there would be a gradual switch from piston engines to turbines, and that the switch would be to the more fuel-efficient turboprop engines rather than pure jets. All three companies were working on a new generation of piston-engined designs, with an eye to turboprop conversion in the future.[citation needed]

De Havilland's pioneering Comet entered airline service in 1952. Initially it was a success, but it was grounded after several fatal crashes in 1953 and 1954. The cause of the Comet crashes had nothing to do with jet engines; it was a rapid metal fatigue failure brought on by cycling the high stresses in corners of the near-square windows from pressurizing the cabin to high altitudes and back. The understanding of metal fatigue that the Comet investigation produced would play a vital part in the good safety record of later types like the DC-8.[citation needed] In 1952 Douglas remained the most successful of the commercial aircraft manufacturers. They had almost 300 orders on hand for the piston-engined DC-6 and its successor, the DC-7, which had yet to fly. The Comet disasters, and the airlines' subsequent lack of interest in jets, seemed to show the wisdom of their staying with propeller-driven aircraft.[citation needed]

Boeing took the bold step of starting to plan a pure-jet airliner as early as 1949. Boeing's military arm had gained experience with large, long-range jets through the B-47 Stratojet (first flight 1947) and the B-52 Stratofortress (1952). With thousands of jet bombers on order or in service, Boeing had developed a close relationship with the US Air Force's Strategic Air Command (SAC). Boeing also supplied the SAC's refueling aircraft, the piston-engined KC-97 Stratofreighters, but these were too slow and low flying to easily work with the new jet bombers. The B-52, in particular, had to descend from its cruising altitude and then slow almost to stall speed to work with the KC-97.[citation needed]

Believing that a requirement for a jet-powered tanker was a certainty, Boeing started work on a new jet aircraft for this role that could be adapted into an airliner. As an airliner it would have similar seating capacity to the Comet, but its swept wing would give it higher cruising speed and better range. First presented in 1950 as the Model 473-60C, Boeing failed to generate any interest at the airlines. Boeing remained convinced that the project was worthwhile, and decided to press ahead with a prototype, the Boeing 367-80 ("Dash-80"). After spending $16 million of their own money on construction, the Dash-80 rolled out on May 15, 1954, and flew the next month. Boeing's plans became obvious, despite the misleading older model number.[citation needed]

Douglas secretly began jet transport project definition studies in mid-1952. By mid-1953 these had developed into a form similar to the final DC-8; an 80-seat, low-wing aircraft with four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojet engines, 30° wing sweep, and an internal cabin diameter of 11 feet (3.35 m) to allow five-abreast seating. Maximum weight was to be 95 tons (86 tonnes), and range was estimated to be about 3,000–4,000 miles (4,800–6,400 km).[citation needed]

Douglas remained lukewarm about the jet airliner project, but believed that the Air Force tanker contract would go to two companies for two different aircraft, as several USAF transport contracts in the past had done. In May 1954, the USAF circulated its requirement for 800 jet tankers to Boeing, Douglas, Convair, Fairchild, Lockheed, and Martin. Boeing was just two months away from having their prototype in the air. Just four months after issuing the tanker requirement, the USAF ordered the first 29 KC-135s from Boeing. Besides Boeing's ability to provide a jet tanker promptly, the flying-boom air-to-air refueling system was also a Boeing product from the KC-97: developing the KC-135 had been a safe bet.[citation needed]

Donald Douglas was shocked by the rapidity of the decision which, he said, had been made before the competing companies even had time to complete their bids. He protested to Washington, but without success. Having started on the DC-8 project, Douglas decided that it was better to press on than give up. Consultations with the airlines resulted in a number of changes: the fuselage was widened by 15 inches (38 cm) to allow six-abreast seating. This led to larger wings and tail surfaces and a longer fuselage.[citation needed] The DC-8 was announced in July 1955. Four versions were offered to begin with, all with the same 150-foot-6-inch (45.87 m) long airframe with a 141-foot-1-inch (43.00 m) wingspan, but varying in engines and fuel capacity, and with maximum weights of about 120–130 tons (109–118 tonnes). Douglas steadfastly refused to offer different fuselage sizes. The maiden flight was planned for December 1957, with entry into revenue service in 1959. Well aware that they were lagging behind Boeing, Douglas began a major marketing push.[citation needed]

Douglas' previous thinking about the airliner market seemed to be coming true; the transition to turbine power looked likely to be to turboprops rather than turbojets. The pioneering 40–60-seat Vickers Viscount was in service and proving popular with passengers and airlines: it was faster, quieter and more comfortable than piston-engined types. Another British rival was the 90-seat Bristol Britannia, and Douglas's main rival in the large airliner market, Lockheed, had committed to the short/medium range 80–100-seat turboprop Electra, with a launch order from American Airlines for 35 and other orders flowing in. Meanwhile, the Comet remained grounded, the French 90-passenger twin jet Sud Aviation Caravelle prototype had just flown for the first time, and the 707 was not expected to be available until late 1958. The major airlines were reluctant to commit themselves to the huge financial and technical challenge of jet aircraft. However, no one could afford not to buy jets if their competitors did.[citation needed]

There the matter rested until October 1955, when Pan American placed simultaneous orders with Boeing for 20 707s and Douglas for 25 DC-8s. To buy one expensive and untried jet-powered aircraft type was brave: to buy both was, at the time, unheard of. In the closing months of 1955, other airlines rushed to follow suit: Air France, American, Braniff, Continental and Sabena ordered 707s; United, National, KLM, Eastern, JAL and SAS chose the DC-8. In 1956 Air India, BOAC, Lufthansa, Qantas and TWA added over 50 to the 707 order book, while Douglas sold 22 DC-8s to Delta, Swissair, TAI, Trans Canada and UAT. By the start of 1958, Douglas had sold 133 DC-8s compared to Boeing's 150 707s.[citation needed]

Basic price of a JT4 powered "domestic" version of the DC-8 was around US$5.46 million (£1.95 million) in 1960.[1]


The first DC-8 N8008D which first flew on 30 May 1958 as a Series 10 aircraft. Converted to Series 51 and operated by Trans International Airways at London Gatwick Airport in 1966

United Airlines chose the DC-8 over the Boeing 707. This Douglas DC-8-50 was photographed at Boston in 1973.
Donald Douglas proposed to build and test the DC-8 at Santa Monica Airport, which had been the birthplace of the DC-3 and home to a Douglas plant that employed 44,000 workers during World War II. In order to accommodate the new jet, Douglas asked the city of Santa Monica, California to lengthen the airport's 5,000-foot runway. Following complaints by neighboring residents, the city refused, so Douglas moved its airliner production line to Long Beach Airport.[2] The first DC-8 N8008D was rolled out of the new Long Beach factory on 9 April 1958 and flew for the first time, in Series 10 form, on 30 May for two hours seven minutes with the crew being led by A.G.Heimerdinger.[3] Later that year an enlarged version of the Comet finally returned to service, but too late to take a substantial portion of the market: de Havilland had just 25 orders. In August Boeing had begun delivering 707s to Pan Am. Douglas made a massive effort to close the gap with Boeing, using no less than ten aircraft for flight testing to achieve FAA certification for the first of the many DC-8 variants in August 1959. Much was needed to be done: the original air brakes on the lower rear fuselage were found ineffective and were deleted as engine thrust reversers had become available; unique leading-edge slots were added to improve low-speed lift; the prototype was 25 kn (46 km/h) short of its promised cruising speed and a new, slightly larger wingtip had to be developed to reduce drag. In addition, a recontoured wing leading edge was later developed to extend the chord 4% and reduce drag at high Mach numbers.[4]

On September 18, 1959, the DC-8 entered service with Delta Air Lines and United.[5] By March 1960, Douglas had reached their planned production rate of eight DC-8s a month. Despite a large number of DC-8 early models available, all used the same basic airframe, differing only in engines, weights and details; in contrast, Boeing's rival 707 range offered several fuselage lengths and two wingspans: the original 144-foot (44 m) 707-120, a 135-foot (41 m) version that sacrificed space to gain longer range, and the stretched 707-320, which at 153 feet (47 m) overall had 10 feet (3.0 m) more cabin space than the DC-8. Douglas' refusal to offer different fuselage sizes made it less adaptable and forced Delta and United to look elsewhere for short/medium range types. Delta ordered Convair 880s but United went for the newly developed lightweight 707-020 but prevailed on Boeing to rename the new variant the "720" in case people thought they were dissatisfied with the DC-8. Significantly, Pan Am never reordered the DC-8 and Douglas gradually lost market share to Boeing. After an excellent start, 1962 DC-8 sales dropped to just 26, followed by 21 in 1963 and 14 in '64; many were for the Jet Trader rather than the more prestigious passenger versions. In 1967, Douglas merged with McDonnell Aircraft Corporation to become McDonnell Douglas.[citation needed]

On August 21, 1961 a Douglas DC-8 broke the sound barrier at Mach 1.012 (660 mph/1,062 km/h) while in a controlled dive through 41,000 feet (12,497 m) and maintained that speed, for 16 seconds. The flight was to collect data on a new leading-edge design for the wing, and while doing so, this DC-8 became the first civilian jet - and the first jet airliner - to make a supersonic flight.[6] The aircraft was a DC-8-43 later delivered to Canadian Pacific Air Lines as CF-CPG. The aircraft, crewed by Captain William Magruder, First Officer Paul Patten, Flight Engineer Joseph Tomich and Flight Test Engineer Richard Edwards, took off from Edwards Air Force Base in California, and was accompanied to altitude by an F-104 flown by Chuck Yeager.[7]


Air Canada DC-8-61
In April 1965, Douglas announced belated fuselage stretches for the DC-8 with three new models known as the Super Sixties. The DC-8 program had been in danger of closing with fewer than 300 aircraft sold, but the Super Sixties brought fresh life to it. By the time production ceased in 1972, 262 of the stretched DC-8s had been made. With the ability to seat 269 passengers, the DC-8 Series 61 and 63 had the largest passenger-carrying capacity available. That remained so until the Boeing 747 arrived in 1970.[citation needed]

All the earlier jetliners were noisy by modern standards. Increasing traffic densities and changing public attitudes led to complaints about aircraft noise and moves to introduce restrictions. As early as 1966 the New York Port Authority expressed concern about the noise to be expected from the then still-unbuilt DC-8-61, and operators had to agree to operate it from New York at lower weights to reduce noise. By the early 1970s, legislation for aircraft noise standards was being introduced in many countries, and the 60 Series DC-8s were particularly at risk of being banned from major airports.[citation needed]

In the early 1970s several airlines approached McDonnell Douglas for noise reduction modifications to the DC-8 but nothing was done. Third parties had developed aftermarket hushkits but there was no real move to keep the DC-8 in service. Finally, in 1975, General Electric began discussions with major airlines with a view to fitting the new and vastly quieter Franco-American CFM56 engine to both DC-8s and 707s. MDC remained reluctant but eventually came on board in the late 1970s and helped develop the Series 70.[citation needed]

The Super Seventies were a great success: roughly 70% quieter than the 60-Series and, at the time of their introduction, the world's quietest four-engined airliner. As well as being quieter and more powerful, the CFM56 was roughly 20% more fuel efficient than the JT3D, which reduced operating costs and extended the range.[citation needed]


Air Transport International DC-8-62F at Thule AB, Greenland.
By 2002, of the 1,032 707s and 720s manufactured for commercial use, just 80 remained in service – though many of those 707s were converted for USAF use, either in service or for spare parts. Of the 556 DC-8s made, around 200 were still in commercial service in 2002, including about 25 50-Series, 82 of the stretched 60-Series, and 96 out of the 110 re-engined 70-Series. Most of the surviving DC-8s are now used as freighters. In May 2009, 97 DC-8s were in service following UPS's decision to retire their remaining fleet of 44.[8] In January 2013, an estimated 36 DC-8s were in use worldwide.[9] As a result of aging, increasing operating costs and strict noise and emissions regulations, the number of active DC-8s continues to decline.

For domestic use, powered by 13,500 lb (60.5 kN) Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C-6 turbojets with water injection. The initial DC-8-11 model had the original, high-drag wingtips and all were converted to DC-8-12 standard. The DC-8-12 had the new wingtips and leading-edge slots, 80 inches long between the engines on each wing and 34 inches long inboard of the inner engines. These unique devices were covered by doors on the upper and lower wing surfaces that opened for low speed flight and closed for cruise. The maximum weight increased from 265,000 to 273,000 pounds (120,200 to 123,800 kg). 28 DC-8-10s were built. This model was originally named "DC-8A" until the series 30 was introduced.[10][page needed] 29 built, 22 for United and 6 for Delta, plus the prototype. By the mid sixties United had converted 15 of its 20 surviving aircraft to DC-8-20 standard and the other 5 to -50s. Delta converted its 6 to DC-8-50s.[citation needed]


DC-8-32 of Overseas National Airways in Zurich, 1975
Higher-powered 15,800 lb (70.8 kN) thrust Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A-3 turbojets (without water injection) allowed a weight increase to 276,000 pounds (125,190 kg). 34 DC-8-20s were built plus 15 converted DC-8-10s. This model was originally named "DC-8B" but was renamed when the series 30 was introduced.[10][page needed]

For intercontinental routes, the three Series 30 variants combined JT4A engines with a one-third increase in fuel capacity and strengthened fuselage and landing gear. The DC-8-31 was certified in March 1960 with 16,800 lb (75.2 kN) JT4A-9 engines for 300,000-pound (136,080 kg) maximum takeoff weight. The DC-8-32 was similar but allowed 310,000-pound (140,600 kg) weight. The DC-8-33 of November 1960 substituted 17,500 lb (78.4 kN) JT4A-11 turbojets, a modification to the flap linkage to allow a 1.5° setting for more efficient cruise, stronger landing gear, and 315,000-pound (142,880 kg) maximum weight. Many -31 and -32 DC-8s were upgraded to this standard. A total of 57 DC-8-30s were produced.[citation needed]


Douglas DC-8-42 of Trans Canada Airlines at London Heathrow in 1962
The DC-8-40 was essentially the -30 but with 17,500 lb (78.4 kN) Rolls-Royce Conway 509 turbofan engines for better efficiency, less noise and less smoke. The Conway was an improvement over the turbojets that preceded it, but the Series 40 sold poorly because of the traditional reluctance of U.S. airlines to buy a foreign product and because the still more advanced Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D turbofan was due in early 1961. The DC-8-41 and DC-8-42 had weights of 300,000 and 310,000 pounds (140,000 and 140,000 kg) respectively, The 315,000-pound (142,880 kg) DC-8-43 had the 1.5° flap setting of the -33 and introduced a 4% leading edge wing extension to reduce drag and increase fuel capacity slightly – the new wing improved range by 8%, lifting capacity by 3.3 tons (3 tonnes), and cruising speed by better than 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). It was used on all later DC-8s. The first DC-8-40 was delivered in 1960; 32 were built.[citation needed]


Douglas DC-8-55 of Garuda Indonesia Airways at Hong Kong-Kai Tak in 1967
The definitive short-fuselage DC-8 with the same engine that powered the vast majority of 707s, the JT3D. Fourteen earlier DC-8s were converted to this standard. All but the -55 were certified in 1961. The DC-8-51, DC-8-52 and DC-8-53 all had 17,000 lb (76.1 kN) JT3D-1 or 18,000 lb (80.6 kN) JT3D-3B engines, varying mainly in their weights: 276,000 pounds (125,200 kg), 300,000 pounds (136,100 kg) and 315,000 pounds (142,900 kg) respectively. The DC-8-55 arrived in June 1964, retaining the JT3D-3B engines but with strengthened structure from the freighter versions and 325,000-pound (147,420 kg) maximum weight. 88 DC-8-50s were built plus the 14 converted from Series 10/30.[citation needed]


The unique EC-24A of the US Navy in storage
DC-8 Jet Trader: Douglas approved development of freighter versions of the DC-8 in May 1961, based on the Series 50. An original plan to fit a fixed bulkhead separating the forward ⅔ of the cabin for freight, leaving the rear cabin for 54 passenger seats was soon replaced by a more practical one to use a movable bulkhead and allow anywhere between 25 and 114 seats with the remainder set aside for cargo. A large cargo door was fitted into the forward fuselage, the cabin floor was reinforced and the rear pressure bulkhead was moved by nearly 7 feet (2.1 m) to make more space. Airlines could order a windowless cabin but only United did, ordering 15 in 1964. The DC-8F-54 had a maximum takeoff weight of 315,000 pounds (142,880 kg) and the DC-8F-55 325,000 pounds (147,420 kg). Both used 18,000 lb (80.6 kN) JT3D-3B powerplants. 54 aircraft built.[citation needed]
EC-24A: A single former United Airlines DC-8F-54 was used by the United States Navy as an electronic warfare training platform. It was retired in October 1998 and is now in storage with the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group.[11]
DC-8 Series 61: The Series 61 was designed for high capacity and medium range. It had the same wings, engines and pylons as the -55, and sacrificed range to gain capacity. Having decided to stretch the DC-8, Douglas inserted a 240-inch (6.1 m) plug in the forward fuselage and a 200-inch (5.1 m) plug aft, taking overall length to 187 feet 4 inches (57.10 m). The added length required strengthening of the structure, but the basic DC-8 design already had sufficient ground clearance to permit the one-third increase in cabin size without requiring longer landing gear.[12] The variant first flew on March 14, 1966 and was certified on September 2, 1966 at a maximum weight of 325,000 pounds (147,420 kg).[13] Deliveries began in January 1967 and it entered service with United Airlines in February 1967.[14][15] It typically carried 180–220 passengers in mixed-class configuration, or 259 in high-density configuration.[16] A cargo door equipped DC-8-61CF was also available. 78 -61 and 10 -61CF were built.[12]

DC-8-63(F) of First International Airways landing at Perth Airport, 2004
DC-8 Series 62: The long-range Series 62 followed in April 1967. It had a more modest stretch, two 40-inch (1.0 m) plugs fore and aft of the wing taking overall length to 157 feet 5 inches (47.98 m), and a number of modifications to provide greater range. 3 feet (0.91 m) wingtip extensions reduced drag and added fuel capacity, and Douglas redesigned the engine pods, extending the pylons and substituting new shorter and neater nacelles, all in the cause of drag reduction. The 18,000 lb JT3D-3B was retained but the engine pylons were redesigned to eliminate their protrusion above the wing and make them sweep forward more sharply, so that the engines were some 40 inches (1.0 m) further forward. The engine pods were also modified with a reduction in diameter and the elimination of the -50 and -61 bypass duct. The changes all improved the aircraft's aerodynamic efficiency. The DC-8 Series 62 is slightly heavier than the -53 or -61 at 335,000 pounds (151,953 kg), and able to seat up to 189 passengers, the -62 had a range with full payload of about 5,200 nautical miles (9,600 km; 6,000 mi), or about the same as the -53 but with 40 extra passengers. Many late production -62s had 350,000 pounds (158,760 kg) maximum takeoff weight and were known as the -62H.[17] Also available as the cargo door equipped convertible -62CF or all cargo -62AF. 51 DC-8-62s were built plus 10 -62CF and 6 -62AF.[18]
DC-8 Series 63: The Series 63 was the final new-build variant and entered service in June 1968. It had the long fuselage of the -61, the aerodynamic refinements and increased fuel capacity of the -62 and 19,000 lb (85.1 kN) JT3D-7 engines.[19] This allowed a maximum take off weight of 350,000 pounds (158,760 kg)[20] and a range with full payload of 4,110 nautical miles (7,610 km; 4,730 mi).[citation needed] Like the -62, the Series 63 was also available as a cargo door equipped -63CF or all cargo -63AF. The freighters had a further increase in Maximum Take Off Weight to 355,000 pounds (161,030 kg). Eastern Airlines bought 6 -63PFs with the strengthened floor of the freighters but no cargo door. 41 DC-8-63s were built, plus 53 -63CF, 7 -63AF and the 6 -63PFs.[21] The Flying Tiger Line was a major early customer for the DC-8-63F.

BAX Global DC-8-71(F) at Boeing Field

NASA Dryden DC-8 airborne laboratory refitted with CFM56 turbofan engines
The DC-8-71 to DC-8-73 were straightforward conversions of the -61 to -63, replacing the JT3D engines with more fuel-efficient 22,000 lb (98.5 kN) CFM56-2 high-bypass turbofans in new housings built by Grumman, along with new engine pylons and fairing of the air intakes below the nose. The DC-8-71 achieved the same end but required more modification because the -61 did not have the improved wings and relocated engines of the -62 and -63. Maximum takeoff weights remained the same, but there was a slight reduction in payload because of the heavier engines. All three models were certified in 1982 and a total of 110 60-Series DC-8s were converted by the time the program ended in 1988.[citation needed]

The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 is a three-engine wide-body jet airliner manufactured by McDonnell Douglas. The DC-10 has range for medium- to long-haul flights, capable of carrying a maximum of 380 passengers. Its most distinguishing feature is the two turbofan engines mounted on underwing pylons and a third engine at the base of the vertical stabilizer. The model was a successor to McDonnell Douglas's DC-8 for long-range operations, and competed in the same markets as the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, which has a similar layout. The DC-10 had a poor safety record initially that was continuously improved over the years.

Production of the DC-10 ended in 1989 with 386 delivered to airlines and 60 to the U.S. Air Force as air-to-air refueling tankers, designated KC-10 Extender.[2] The largest operator of the DC-10 is U.S. cargo airline FedEx Express. The DC-10 was succeeded by the related McDonnell Douglas MD-11. Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, conducted an upgrade program that equipped many in-service DC-10s with a glass cockpit that eliminated the flight engineer position; the upgraded aircraft were re-designated as MD-10s. The DC-10's last commercial passenger flight took place in February 2014, although freighter versions continue to operate.

Following an unsuccessful proposal for the U.S. Air Force's CX-HLS (Heavy Logistics System) in 1965, Douglas Aircraft began design studies based on its CX-HLS design. In 1966, American Airlines offered a specification to manufacturers for a widebody aircraft smaller than the Boeing 747 but capable of flying similar long-range routes from airports with shorter runways. The DC-10 became McDonnell Douglas's first commercial airliner after the merger between McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and Douglas Aircraft Company in 1967.[3] An early DC-10 design proposal was for a four-engine double-deck wide-body jet airliner with a maximum seating capacity of 550 passengers similar in length of a DC-8. The proposal was shelved in favor of a trijet single-deck wide-body airliner with a maximum seating capacity of 399 passengers, and similar in length to the DC-8 Super 60.[4]

The DC-10 was first ordered by launch customers American Airlines with 25 orders, and United Airlines with 30 orders and 30 options in 1968.[5][6] The first DC-10, a series 10, made its maiden flight on August 29, 1970.[7] Following a test program with 929 flights covering 1,551 hours, the DC-10 received its type certificate from the FAA on July 29, 1971.[8] It entered commercial service with American Airlines on August 5, 1971 on a round trip flight between Los Angeles and Chicago. United Airlines began DC-10 service on August 16, 1971.[9] American's DC-10s had 206 seats and United's had 222; both had six-across seating in first-class and eight-across (four pairs) in coach.[10] The DC-10's similarity to the Lockheed L-1011 in design, passenger capacity, and launch date resulted in a sales competition that affected profitability of the aircraft.


Northwest Airlines DC-10-30 at London Gatwick Airport, 2003
The first DC-10 version was the "domestic" series 10 with a range of 3,800 miles (3,300 nmi, 6,110 km) with a typical passenger load and a range of 2,710 miles (2,350 nmi, 4,360 km) with maximum payload. The series 15 had a typical load range of 4,350 miles (3,780 nmi, 7,000 km).[11][12] The series 20 was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D turbofan engines, whereas the series 10 and 30 engines were General Electric CF6. Before delivery of its aircraft, Northwest's president asked that the "series 20" aircraft be redesignated "series 40" because the aircraft was much improved over the original design. The FAA issued the series 40 certificate on October 27, 1972.[13]

The series 30 and 40 were the longer-range "international" versions. The main visible difference between the models is that the series 10 has three sets of landing gear (one front and two main) while the series 30 and 40 have an additional centerline main gear. The center main two-wheel landing gear (which extends from the center of the fuselage) was added to distribute the extra weight and for additional braking. The series 30 had a typical load range of 6,220 mi (10,010 km) and a maximum payload range of 4,604 mi (7,410 km). The series 40 had a typical load range of 5,750 miles (9,265 km) and a maximum payload range of 4,030 miles (3,500 nmi, 6,490 km).[11][14]

Eventually, the DC-10 was able to distinguish itself from its competitor with two engine options, as well as earlier introduction of longer-range variants than the L-1011. The 446th and final DC-10 rolled off the Long Beach, California Products Division in production line in December 1988 and was delivered to Nigeria Airways in July 1989.[2][15] The production run exceeded the 1971 estimate of 438 deliveries needed to break even on the project.[16] As the final DC-10s were delivered McDonnell Douglas had started production of its successor, the MD-11.[17]


DC-10-30 flight deck
The DC-10 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane, powered by three turbofan engines. Two engines are mounted on pylons that attach to the bottom of the wings, while the third engine is encased in a protective banjo-shaped structure that is mounted on the top of the rear fuselage. The vertical stabilizer, with its two-segment rudder, is mounted on top of the tail engine banjo. The horizontal stabilizer and its four-segment elevator, is attached to the sides of the rear fuselage in the conventional manner. The airliner has a retractable tricycle landing gear. To enable higher gross weights, the later -30 and -40 series have an additional two-wheel main landing gear, which retracts into the center of the fuselage.[18]

It was designed for medium to long-range flights that can accommodate 250 to 380 passengers, and is operated by a cockpit flight crew of three. The fuselage has underfloor stowage for cargo and baggage.[19]

DC-10-10
The DC-10-10 is the initial passenger version, produced from 1970 to 1981. The DC-10-10 was equipped with GE CF6-6 engines, which was the first civil engine version the CF6 family. A total of 122 were built.[20]
DC-10-10CF
The -10CF is a convertible passenger and cargo transport version of the -10. Eight were built for Continental Airlines and one for United Airlines.[20]
DC-10-15
The -15 variant was designed for use at hot and high airports. The series 15 is basically a -10 fitted with higher-thrust GE CF6-50C2F (derated DC-10-30 engines) powerplants.[21] The -15 was first ordered in 1979 by Mexicana and Aeroméxico. Seven were completed between 1981 and 1983.[22]

Japan Airlines DC-10-40 at Kansai International Airport in 2001

FedEx became the first U.S. carrier to equip its aircraft with an anti-missile defense system in 2006. The gray oval Northrop Grumman Guardian pod can be seen on the belly of this FedEx MD-10 between and just aft of the main landing gear.
DC-10-20
A proposed version of the DC-10-10 with extra fuel tanks, 3-ft (0.9 m) extensions on each wingtip and a rear center landing gear. It was to use Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-15 turbofan engines, each producing 45,500 lbf (203 kN) of thrust, with a maximum takeoff weight of 530,000 lb (240,400 kg). But engine improvements led to increased thrust and increased takeoff weight.[23] Northwest Orient Airlines, one of the launch customers for this longer-range DC-10 requested the name change to DC-10-40.[24]
DC-10-30
A long-range model and the most common model produced. It was built with General Electric CF6-50 turbofan engines and larger fuel tanks to increase range and fuel efficiency, as well as a set of rear center landing gear to support the increased weight. It was very popular with European flag carriers. A total of 163 were built from 1972 to 1988 and delivered to 38 different customers.[25] The model was introduced in service on November 30, 1972, with Swissair and KLM as its first customers.[citation needed]
DC-10-30CF
The convertible cargo/passenger transport version of the -30. The first deliveries were to Overseas National Airways and Trans International Airlines in 1973. A total of 27 were built.[20]
DC-10-30ER
The extended-range version of the -30. The -30ER aircraft has a higher maximum takeoff weight of 590,000 lb (267,600 kg), is powered by three GE CF6-50C2B engines each producing 54,000 lbf (240 kN) of thrust and is equipped with an additional fuel tank in the rear cargo hold.[26][27] It has an additional 700 mi of range to 6,600 mi (5,730 nmi, 10,620 km). The first of this variant was delivered to Finnair in 1981. A total of six were built and five -30s were later converted to -30ERs.
DC-10-30AF
Also known as the DC-10-30F. This was the all freight version of the -30. Production was to start in 1979, but Alitalia did not confirm its order then. Production began in May 1984 after the first aircraft order from FedEx. A total of 10 were built.[28]
DC-10-40
The first long-range version fitted with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D engines. Originally designated DC-10-20, this model was renamed DC-10-40 after a special request from Northwest Orient Airlines as the aircraft was much improved compared to its original design, with a higher MTOW (on par with the Series 30) and more powerful engines. The airline's president wanted to advertise he had the latest version.[24][29] The company also wanted its aircraft to be equipped with the same engines as its Boeing 747s for commonality.[30] Northwest Orient Airlines and Japan Airlines were the only airlines to order the Series 40 with 22 and 20 aircraft, respectively. Engine improvements led to the DC-10-40s delivered to Northwest featuring Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-20 engines producing 50,000 lbf (222 kN) of thrust and a MTOW of 555,000 lb (251,815 kg). The -40s for Japan Airlines were equipped with P&amp;W JT9D-59A engines that produced a thrust of 53,000 lbf (235.8 kN) and a MTOW of 565,000 lb (256,350 kg).[23] 42 were built from 1973 to 1983.[31] Externally, the DC-10-40 can be distinguished from the -30 series by a slight bulge near the front of the nacelle for the #2 (tail) engine.
DC-10-50
A proposed version with Rolls-Royce RB211-524 engines for British Airways. The order never came and the plans for the DC-10-50 were abandoned.[32]
DC-10 "Twin"
A proposed downsized DC-10 version with two CF-6 engines, likely designed to compete against the Airbus A300.[citation needed]

A USAF KC-10 Extender during refueling
The KC-10 Extender is a military version of the DC-10-30CF for aerial refueling. The aircraft was ordered by the U.S. Air Force and delivered from 1981 to 1988. A total of 60 were built.[33]

The KDC-10 is an aerial refueling tanker for the Royal Netherlands Air Force. These were converted from civil airliners (DC-10-30CF) to a similar standard as the KC-10. Also, commercial refueling companies Omega Aerial Refueling Services and Global Airtanker Service operate two KDC-10 tankers for lease. Four have been built.[34][35]


The DC-10 Air Tanker during a water drop demonstration
The DC-10 Air Tanker is a DC-10-based firefighting tanker aircraft, using modified water tanks from Erickson Air-Crane.

The MD-10 is retrofit cockpit upgrade to the DC-10 and a re-designation to MD-10. The upgrade included an Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) used on the MD-11 and was launched in 1996.[36] The new cockpit eliminated the need for the flight engineer position and allowed common type rating with the MD-11. This allows companies such as FedEx Express, which operate both the MD-10 and MD-11, to have a common pilot pool for both aircraft. The MD-10 conversion now falls under the Boeing Converted Freighter program where Boeing's international affiliate companies perform the conversions.[37]

Orbis DC-10 Flying Eye Hospital, 2009
In July 2015, there were 56 DC-10s and MD-10s in airline service with operators FedEx Express (50), Kelowna Flightcraft Air Charter (2), and others with fewer aircraft.[38] The aging models are now largely used as dedicated freight aircraft. "The DC-10 is going to be remembered as a better cargo plane than passenger plane," said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group.[39]

On January 8, 2007, Northwest Airlines retired its last remaining DC-10 from scheduled passenger service,[40] thus ending the aircraft's operations with major airlines. Regarding the retirement of Northwest's DC-10 fleet, Wade Blaufuss, spokesman for the Northwest chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association said, "The DC-10 is a reliable airplane, fun to fly, roomy and quiet, kind of like flying an old Cadillac Fleetwood. We're sad to see an old friend go."[39] Biman Bangladesh Airlines was the last commercial carrier to operate the DC-10 in passenger service.[41][42][43] The airline flew the DC-10 on a regular passenger flight for the last time on February 20, 2014, from Dhaka, Bangladesh to Birmingham, UK.[42][44] Local charter flights were flown in the UK until February 24, 2014.[45]

Non-airline operators include the Royal Netherlands Air Force with three DC-10-30CF-based KDC-10 tanker aircraft, the USAF with its 59 KC-10s, and the 10 Tanker Air Carrier with its modified DC-10-10 used for fighting wildfires.[46] Orbis International has used a DC-10 as a flying eye hospital. Surgery is performed on the ground and the operating room is located between the wings for maximum stability. In 2008, Orbis chose to replace its aging DC-10-10 with a DC-10-30 jointly donated by FedEx and United Airlines.[47][48] The newer DC-10 was to be converted into MD-10 configuration, and begin flying as an eye hospital in 2010.[48][49][50] One former American Airlines DC-10-10 is operated by the Missile Defense Agency as the Widebody Airborne Sensor Platform (WASP).[51]

As of September 2015, the DC-10 has been involved in 55 accidents and incidents,[52] including 32 hull-loss accidents,[53] with 1,261 occupant fatalities.[54] Of these accidents and incidents, it has been involved in 9 hijackings resulting in 1 death and a bombing resulting in 170 occupant fatalities.[54] Despite its troubled beginnings in the 1970s, which gave it an unfavorable reputation,[55] the DC-10 has proved to be a reliable aircraft with an overall low accident rate as of 1998.[56] The DC-10's initially poor safety record has continuously improved as design flaws were rectified and fleet hours increased.[56] The DC-10's lifetime safety record is comparable to similar second-generation passenger jets as of 2008.[57]

The DC-10 was designed with cargo doors that opened outward instead of conventional inward-opening "plug-type" doors. Using outward-opening doors allowed the DC-10's cargo area to be completely filled since the door was not occupying usable space. To secure the door against the outward force from the pressurization of the fuselage at high altitudes, outward-opening doors must use heavy locking mechanisms. In the event of a door lock malfunction, there is great potential for explosive decompression.[58]

A problem with the outward-opening cargo door first became publicly known on June 12, 1972, when American Airlines Flight 96 lost its aft cargo door shortly after takeoff from Detroit Metro Airport. Before Flight 96 took off, an airport employee had forced the door shut, which, due to the cargo door's design, gave an outward appearance of being securely locked despite the internal locking mechanism not being fully engaged. Subsequently, when the aircraft reached approximately 11,750 feet (3,580 m) in altitude, the rear cargo door blew out, causing an explosive decompression that partially collapsed the cabin floor above the door. This collapsed section of the floor cut or impeded many of the control cables to the empennage control systems necessary to fly the aircraft.[59][60] The crew was able to accomplish an emergency landing by using the ailerons, right elevator, some limited rudder trim and asymmetrical thrust of the wing engines.[61]

During the investigation of the near-crash of Flight 96, U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators found that the DC-10's cargo door design was dangerously flawed. The door relied on a set of heavy steel hooks to secure it against the door frame. When the hooks were fully engaged, an outside lever on the cargo door could be depressed to drive a set of locking pins through the hooks to hold them in place. The NTSB investigation found that it was possible to close the outside lever without the hooks being fully engaged, and there would be no outward signs that the locking mechanism was not engaged; the cargo door indicator in the cockpit would still register the door as being secured without hooks and locking pins being in the closed position. This combination of factors caused Flight 96 to take off without its aft cargo door being fully locked. When the door blew out at altitude, the sudden decompression created a large pressure differential between the cabin above and the cargo bay below, causing the cabin floor to collapse.[62] The collapse of the cabin floor severely damaged some of the vital flight control wires and hydraulic lines routed through the floor beams, which left the pilots with very limited control of the aircraft.[59]

Following the Windsor accident investigation, the NTSB made several recommendations, including repairing the faulty cargo door design to make it impossible for baggage handlers to close the cargo door lever without the locking pins being fully engaged. It was also recommended that vents be installed in the cabin floor so that, in case of an explosive decompression, the pressure difference between the cabin and cargo bay could quickly be equalized without collapsing the cabin floor and damaging critical control systems.[62] Although many carriers voluntarily modified the cargo doors, no airworthiness directive was issued to require reworking of the locking system, due to a gentlemen's agreement between the head of the FAA, John H. Shaffer, and McDonnell Douglas, Jackson McGowen. McDonnell Douglas did make modifications to the cargo door, but the basic design remained unchanged and problems persisted.[62]

On March 3, 1974, an almost identical cargo door blow-out caused Turkish Airlines Flight 981 to crash into a forest near the town of Ermenonville, France shortly after leaving Paris.[62] All 346 people were killed[63] in one of the deadliest air crashes of all time.[64] Circumstances of this crash were very similar to the previous accident. The cargo door had not been fully locked, though it appeared so to both cockpit crew and ground personnel. The Turkish aircraft had a different seating configuration that exacerbated the effects of decompression, which caused the aircraft's floor to collapse into the cargo bay. Control cables running below the floor of the aircraft were severed when the floor collapsed and this rendered it uncontrollable.[62] Crash investigators found that the DC-10's relief vents were not large enough to equalize the pressure between the passenger and cargo compartments during explosive decompression.[63] Following this crash, a special subcommittee of the House of Representatives investigated the cargo door issue and the FAA's certification of the original design.[65] An airworthiness directive was issued, and all DC-10s underwent mandatory door modifications.[65] The DC-10 experienced no more major incidents related to its cargo door after FAA-approved changes were made.[62]

The DC-10 experienced another major accident with the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 on May 25, 1979. The number one (left wing) engine of Flight 191 broke off after taking off from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, US.[66] As the engine separated upwards, it ripped through the leading edge of the wing, rupturing hydraulic lines. Without hydraulic pressure, the left wing leading edge slats retracted due to the force of the air moving over the wings. That, in turn, increased the stall speed of the left wing above the engine failure climb out speed being used by the pilots. When the left wing stalled, the aircraft rapidly rolled to the left and crashed before the flight crew could recover. All 271 people on board, plus two on the ground, were killed.[67]

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) officials discovered that a maintenance procedure was the cause. American Airlines mechanics removed the engine and its pylon together, rather than removing the engine from the pylon then the pylon from the wing, as recommended by McDonnell Douglas. This was done using a forklift and the pylon was inadvertently cracked in the process. The short-cut procedure, believed to save many man hours on maintenance, was used by three major airlines, although McDonnell Douglas advised against it.[68] In November 1979, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) fined American Airlines $500,000 for using this faulty maintenance procedure. Continental Airlines was fined $100,000 on a similar charge.[68][69]

The Chicago accident also highlighted a major deficiency in the DC-10 design: its lack of a locking mechanism to maintain the position of the leading-edge slats in the event of a hydraulic or pneumatic failure.[68] Other wide-body aircraft of the day carried such a feature. When the engine pulled up and over the wing, it tore out electrical wiring in the wing, thus rendering vital warning instruments in the cockpit inoperable. Following the Chicago crash, the FAA withdrew the DC-10's type certificate on June 6, 1979, which grounded U.S. DC-10s. It also banned all DC-10s from U.S. airspace. These measures were rescinded on July 13 after modifications were made to the slat actuation and position systems, along with stall warning and power supply changes.[68][70]

Another major DC-10 crash was the United Airlines Flight 232 crash at Sioux City, Iowa, on July 19, 1989. The number two (tail) engine suffered an uncontained fan disk failure in flight, which damaged all three hydraulic systems and rendered the hydraulic flight controls inoperable. The flight crew, led by Captain Al Haynes and assisted by a senior pilot flying as a passenger (Dennis E. "Denny" Fitch), performed an emergency landing by constantly adjusting the thrust of the remaining two engines. The crew managed to fly the aircraft onto the runway in a partially controlled manner, and 185 of the 296 people on board survived in spite of the destruction of the aircraft during the crash-landing.[71]

The DC-10 included no cable backup for the hydraulic powered flight controls because it was considered nearly impossible for three hydraulic systems to fail during one flight, and furthermore the control surfaces are too large to be moved without hydraulic assistance. However, all three hydraulic systems were in close proximity, directly beneath the tail engine. The #2 engine explosion hurled fragments that ruptured all three lines, resulting in total loss of control to the elevators, ailerons, spoilers, horizontal stabilizer, rudder, flaps and slats.[71]

Following the UAL 232 accident, hydraulic fuses were installed in the #3 hydraulic system in the area below the #2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure that sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. It is still possible to lose all three hydraulic systems elsewhere. This nearly occurred to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff, when a main gear tire exploded in the wheel well. The damage in the left wing area caused total loss of pressure in the #1 and the #2 hydraulic systems. The #3 system was dented but not penetrated.[72]

Other notable incidents and accidents are:

November 3, 1973 - National Airlines Flight 27, a DC-10-10 cruising at 39,000 feet, experienced an uncontained failure of the right (#3) engine. One cabin window separated from the fuselage after it was struck by debris flung from the exploding engine. The passenger sitting next to that window was forced through the opening and ejected from the aircraft. The crew initiated an emergency descent, and landed the aircraft safely.[citation needed]
November 12, 1975 - An ONA DC-10 on a ferry flight struck a heavy flock of seagulls while on its take-off roll from Kennedy International Airport, New York. The captain aborted below V1 speed, but the #3 engine exploded, causing a partial braking failure. The landing gear collapsed and fire eventually destroyed the plane. All 139 ONA employees on board survived. Two were seriously injured, while 30 others had minor injuries.[73][specify]
January 2, 1976 - An ONA DC-10 experienced an undershoot on the short runway in Istanbul, Turkey. The aircraft touched the ground and crash-landed then a fire in the #1 engine started. The aircraft was destroyed. All passengers survived.[74][specify]
October 31, 1979 - Western Airlines Flight 2605, a DC-10-10, collided with construction equipment after landing on a closed runway at Mexico City International Airport, killing 72 of the 88 people on board and one person on the ground.[citation needed]
November 11, 1979 - an Aeromexico DC-10 entered a sustained stall while climbing through 29,800 ft, to its assigned cruise altitude of 31,000 ft, over Luxembourg, Europe. The flight crew failed to monitor their flight instruments, so they did not immediately recognize the plane was in a stalled condition. Instead, they blamed the heavy buffeting on the #3 engine, which they shut down, while continuing to hold the nose up. The plane continued to descend for one minute in a fully stalled condition, until the pilots lowered the nose and began a proper stall recovery procedure, which was completed at 18,900 ft. The #3 engine was then restarted, the declaration of emergency canceled and the flight continued to Miami, Florida. Ground inspection revealed four feet missing from each of the outboard elevator tips, including the balance weights. The NTSB concluded the sustained stall buffeting produced a dynamic structural overload on the elevator, which resulted in the failure of the elevator tips and balance weights. Further, the NTSB concluded the autopilot had improperly been placed in vertical speed mode. That forced the AP to keep increasing the angle of attack, to maintain the preselected vertical speed number, because maximum available engine thrust declined (normally) with increasing altitude. That in turn, caused the airspeed to fall below the stall speed of the aircraft.[75]
November 28, 1979 - Air New Zealand Flight 901, DC-10-30 ZK-NZP, crashed into Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica during a sightseeing flight over the continent, killing all 257 on board. The accident was caused by the flight coordinates being altered without the flight crew's knowledge, combined with unique Antarctic weather conditions.[76]
January 12, 1981 - Garuda Indonesia DC-10-30 PK-GIB overran the runway on landing at Hasanuddin Airport, Ujung Pandang, Sulawesi, Indonesia and was substantially damaged.[77]
January 23, 1982 - World Airways Flight 30, DC-10-30CF registration N113WA, overran the runway at Boston Logan International Airport. All 12 crew survived, but two of the 200 passengers were never found.[78]
September 13, 1982 – Spantax Flight 995, DC-10-30CF EC-DEG, was destroyed by fire after an aborted take-off at Málaga, Spain. A total of 50 passengers were killed and 110 injured due to the flames.[citation needed]
December 23, 1983 – Korean Air Cargo Flight 084, DC-10-30CF HL7339, was destroyed after colliding head-on with a Piper PA-31 Navajo while taxiing at Anchorage, Alaska. All on board both aircraft survived.[citation needed]
July 27, 1989 – Korean Air Flight 803, DC-10-30 HL7328, crashed short of the runway in bad weather while trying to land at Tripoli, Libya. A total of 75 of the 199 on board plus another 4 people on the ground were killed in the accident.[79]
September 19, 1989 – UTA Flight 772, DC-10-30 N54629, crashed in the Ténéré Desert in Niger following an in-flight bomb explosion, claiming the lives of all 170 on board.[citation needed]
December 21, 1992 – Martinair Flight 495, DC-10-30CF PH-MBN, crashed while landing in bad weather at Faro, Portugal killing 56 passengers.[citation needed]
April 7, 1994 - FedEx Flight 705, DC-10-30 N306FE, experienced an attempted hijacking. FedEx employee Auburn Calloway tried to hijack the aircraft with the intention of crashing it, but the crew fought him off and returned to Memphis. The co-pilot used a number of acrobatic maneuvers to assist his colleagues in fighting off Calloway, such as putting the DC-10 into a steep dive and flying inverted.[citation needed]
June 13, 1996 – Garuda Indonesia Flight 865, DC-10-30 PK-GIE, had just taken off from Fukuoka Airport, Japan when a high-pressure blade from engine #3 separated. The aircraft was just a few feet above the runway and the pilot decided to abort the take-off. Consequently, the DC-10 skidded off the runway and came to a halt 1,600 ft (490 m) past it, losing one of its engines and its landing gear.[citation needed]
The Air France Concorde crash of 2000 was attributed to a metal fragment that fell from the thrust reverser of a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off four minutes earlier. This fragment was traced to third-party replacement parts not approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.[80]

The preserved forward fuselage segment of Monarch Airlines' DC-10-30, G-DMCA,[81] is on display at Manchester Airport Aviation Viewing Park, where it is used for teaching and school visits. The segment has been repainted to match the current livery used by the airline.

The Airbus A300 is a short- to medium-range wide-body twin-engine jet airliner that was developed and manufactured by Airbus. Released in 1972 as the world's first twin-engined widebody, it was the first product of Airbus Industrie, a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers, now a subsidiary of Airbus Group. The A300 can typically seat 266 passengers in a two-class layout, with a maximum range of 4,070 nautical miles (7,540 km) when fully loaded, depending on model.

Launch customer Air France introduced the type into service on 30 May 1974. Production of the A300 ceased in July 2007, along with its smaller A310 derivative. Freighter sales for which the A300 competed are to be fulfilled by a new A330-200F derivative.[3] The third production A300 is now a zero gravity plane and travels to airshows around Europe.

The requirements were stated in 1966 by Frank Kolk, an American Airlines executive, for a Boeing 727 replacement on busy short- to medium-range routes such as United States transcontinental flights. His brief included a passenger capacity of 250 to 300 seated in a twin-aisle configuration and fitted with two engines, with the capability of carrying full passenger loads without penalty from high-altitude airports like Denver. American manufacturers responded with widebody trijets, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar, as twinjets were banned from many routes by the FAA.

On 26 September 1967, the British, French, and West German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding to start development of the 300-seat Airbus A300.[4] An earlier announcement had been made in July 1967, but at that time the announcement had been clouded by the British Government's support for the Airbus, which coincided with its refusal to back British Aircraft Corporation's (BAC) proposed competitor, a development of the BAC 1-11, despite a preference for the latter expressed by British European Airways (BEA). In the months following this agreement, both the French and British governments expressed doubts about the aircraft.[which?] Another problem was the requirement for a new engine to be developed by Rolls-Royce; the triple-spool RB207 of 47,500 lbf.[5] In December 1968, the French and British partner companies (Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley) proposed a revised configuration, the 250-seat Airbus A250. Renamed the A300B, the aircraft would not require new engines, reducing development costs.[6] To attract potential US customers, American General Electric CF6-50 engines powered the A300 instead of the British RB207. The British government withdrew from the venture; however, the British firm Hawker-Siddeley stayed on as a contractor, developing the wings for the A300, which were pivotal in later versions' impressive performance from short domestic to long intercontinental flights.[citation needed] (Years later, through British Aerospace, the UK re-entered the consortium.)

Airbus Industrie was formally set up in 1970 following an agreement between Aérospatiale (France) and the antecedents to Deutsche Aerospace (Germany). They were joined by the Spanish CASA in 1971. Each company would deliver its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly assemblies.

The first prototype A300 was unveiled on 28 September 1972, making its maiden flight from Toulouse–Blagnac Airport on 28 October that year,[7] which was later commemorated on a French three franc stamp.[citation needed] The first production model, the A300B2, entered service in 1974 followed by the A300B4 one year later. Initially the success of the consortium was poor, but by 1979 there were 81 aircraft in service. It was the launch of the A320 in 1987 that established Airbus in the aircraft market – over 400 orders were placed before it flew, compared to 15 for the A300 in 1972.

The A300 was the first airliner to use just-in-time manufacturing techniques. Complete aircraft sections were manufactured by consortium partners all over Europe. These were airlifted to the final assembly line at Toulouse-Blagnac by a fleet of Boeing 377-derived Aero Spacelines Super Guppy aircraft. Originally devised as a way to share the work among Airbus' partners without the expense of two assembly lines, it turned out to be a more efficient way of building aircraft (more flexible and reduced costs) as opposed to building the whole aircraft at one site.

Airbus partners employed the latest technology, some derived from Concorde. On entry into service in 1974, the A300 was a very advanced plane and influenced later subsonic airliner designs. The technological highlights include:

Advanced wings by de Havilland (later BAE Systems) with:
Supercritical airfoil section for economical performance
advanced aerodynamically efficient flight control surfaces
5.64 m (222 in) diameter circular fuselage section for 8-abreast passenger seating and wide enough for 2 LD3 cargo containers side-by-side
Structures made from metal billets, reducing weight
First airliner to be fitted with wind shear protection
Advanced autopilots capable of flying the aircraft from climb-out to landing
Electrically controlled braking system
Later A300s incorporate other advanced features such as:

2-man crew by automating the flight engineer's functions, an industry first
Glass cockpit flight instruments
Extensive use of composites for an aircraft of its era
Center-of-gravity control by shifting around fuel
Wingtip fences for better aerodynamics (first introduced on the A310-300).
All these made the A300 a more economical substitute for widebody trijets such as McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 for short to medium routes. On the early versions, Airbus used the same engines and similar major systems as the DC-10.[citation needed]

After the launch, sales of the A300 were weak for some years, with most orders going to airlines that had an obligation to favour the domestically made product – notably Air France and Lufthansa[citation needed]. At one stage, Airbus had 16 "whitetail" A300s – completed but unsold aircraft – sitting on the tarmac. Germanair was the world's first charter airline and Indian Airlines was the world's first domestic airline to purchase the A300. These have now been retired.

In 1974, Korean Air ordered 4 A300s, becoming the first non-European international airline to order Airbus aircraft. Airbus saw South-East Asia as a vital market ready to be opened up and believed Korean Air to be the 'key'.[8]

It was becoming clear that the whole concept of a short haul widebody was flawed. Airlines operating the A300 on short haul routes were forced to reduce frequencies to try and fill the aircraft. As a result they lost passengers to airlines operating more frequent narrow body flights. The supposed widebody comfort which it was assumed passengers would demand was illusory. Eventually, Airbus had to build its own narrowbody aircraft (the A320) to compete with the Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9/MD-80. The saviour of the A300 was the advent of Extended Range Twin Operations (ETOPS), a revised FAA rule which allows twin-engined airliners to fly long-distance routes that were previously off-limits to them. This enabled Airbus to develop the aircraft as a medium/long range airliner.

In 1977, US carrier Eastern Air Lines leased four A300s as an in-service trial. Frank Borman, ex-astronaut and the then CEO, was impressed that the A300 consumed 30% less fuel than his fleet of Tristars and then ordered 23 of the type (This order is often cited as the point at which Airbus came to be seen as a serious competitor to the large American aircraft-manufacturers Boeing and McDonnell Douglas). This was followed by an order from Pan Am. From then on, the A300 family sold well, eventually reaching a total of 878 delivered aircraft.[1][2]

In December 1977, AeroCóndor Colombia became the first Airbus operator in Latin America, leasing one Airbus A300, named "Ciudad de Barranquilla".

The aircraft found particular favour with Asian airlines, being bought by Japan Air System, Korean Air, China Eastern Airlines, Thai Airways International, Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, China Airlines, Pakistan International Airlines, Indian Airlines, Trans Australia Airlines and many others. As Asia did not have restrictions similar to the FAA 60-minutes rule for twin-engine airliners which existed at the time, Asian airlines used A300s for routes across the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea.

In 1977, the A300B4 became the first ETOPS compliant aircraft – its high performance and safety standards qualified it for Extended Twin Engine Operations over water, providing operators with more versatility in routing. In 1982 Garuda Indonesia became the first airline to fly the A300B4-200FF. By 1981, Airbus was growing rapidly, with over 300 aircraft sold and options for 200 more planes for over forty airlines. Alarmed by the success of the A300, Boeing responded with the new Boeing 767.

The A300 provided Airbus the experience of manufacturing and selling airliners competitively. The basic fuselage of the A300 was later stretched (A330 and A340), shortened (A310), or modified into derivatives (A300-600ST Beluga Super Transporter).The largest freight operator of the A300 is FedEx Express, which, as of January 2012, had 71 A300 aircraft in service. UPS Airlines also operates freighter versions of the A300. The final version was the A300-600R and is rated for 180-minute ETOPS. The A300 has enjoyed renewed interest in the secondhand market for conversion to freighters. The freighter versions – either new-build A300-600s or converted ex-passenger A300-600s, A300B2s and B4s – account for most of the world freighter fleet after the Boeing 747 freighter.

In March 2006 Airbus announced the closure of the A300/A310 line[9] making them the first Airbus aircraft to be discontinued. The final production A300 made its initial flight on 18 April 2007[10] and was delivered on 12 July 2007. It was an A300F freighter for FedEx. Airbus has announced a support package to keep A300s flying commercially until at least 2025.


This A300B1 was the second A300 built and one of the first to enter airline service in November 1974. It was operated by Trans European Airways of Belgium until retirement from service in November 1990.

Only two were built: the first prototype, registered F-WUAB, then F-OCAZ, and a second aircraft, F-WUAC, which was leased in November 1974 to Trans European Airways (TEA) and re-registered OO-TEF. TEA instantly subleased the aircraft for six weeks to Air Algérie, but continued to operate the aircraft until 1990. It had accommodation for 300 passengers (TEA) or 323 passengers (Air Algérie) with a maximum weight of 132,000 kg and two General Electric CF6-50A engines of 220 kN thrust. The A300B1 was shorter than the later production versions, being only 50.95 m (167.2 ft) in length.

The first production version. Powered by General Electric CF6 or Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D engines (the same engines that powered the Boeing 747-100, "the original jumbo jet") of between 227 and 236 kN thrust, it entered service with Air France in May 1974. The prototype A300B2 made its first flight on 28 June 1973 and was certificated by the French and German authorities on 15 March 1974 and FAA approval followed on 30 May 1974. The first production A300B2 (A300 number 5) made its maiden flight on 15 April 1974 and was handed over to Air France a few weeks later on 10 May 1974. The A300B2 entered revenue service on 23 May 1974 between Paris and London.

A300B2-100: 137 Metric Ton MTOW
A300B2-200: 142 Metric Ton MTOW, with Krüger flaps, first delivery to South African Airways in 1976
A300B2-300: increased Maximum Landing Weight/Maximum Zero Fuel Weight

Garuda Indonesia is the launch customer of Airbus A300B4-200FF series in 1982
The major production version. Features a centre fuel tank for increased fuel capacity (47,500 kg). Production of the B2 and B4 totalled 248. The first A300B4 (the 9th A300) flew on 25 December 1974 and was certified on 26 March 1975. The first delivery was made to Germanair (which later merged into Hapag Lloyd) on 23 May 1975.

A300B4-100: 157.5 Metric Ton MTOW, first delivery to Germanair in 1975.
A300B4-200: 165 Metric Ton MTOW, first delivery to Hapag-Lloyd Flug in 1980
A300B4-200FF: An A300 with a "forward-facing" crew compartment. The world's first 2-crew widebody airliner. Includes some of the A310's and A300-600's digital avionics. First saw service with Garuda Indonesia in 1982, further customers were VASP, Tunisair and Kar-Air/Finnair.
A300B4-600: Referred to as the A300-600. See Below.
A300C4: Convertible freighter version, with a large cargo door on the port side. First delivered to South African Airways in October 1982.
A300F4-200: Freighter version of the A300B4-200. First delivery occurred in 1986, but only very few were built as the A300F4-200 was soon replaced by the more capable A300-600F (official designation: A300F4-600).
Officially designated A300B4-600, this version is nearly the same length as the B2 and B4 but has increased space because it uses the A310 rear fuselage and tail. It has higher power CF6-80 or Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 engines and uses the Honeywell 331-250 auxiliary power unit (APU).[11] The A300-600 entered service in 1983 with Saudi Arabian Airlines and a total of 313 A300-600s (all versions) have been sold. The A300-600 also has a similar cockpit to the A310, eliminating the need for a flight engineer. The FAA issues a single type rating which allows operation of both the A310 and A300-600.

A300-600: (Official designation: A300B4-600) The baseline model of the −600 series.
A300-620C: (Official designation: A300C4-620) A convertible freighter version. First delivery December 1985.
A300-600F: (Official designation: A300F4-600) The freighter version of the baseline −600.
A300-600R: (Official designation: A300B4-600R) The increased range −600, achieved by an additional trim fuel tank in the tail. First delivery in 1988 to American Airlines; all A300s built since 1989 (freighters included) are −600Rs. Japan Air System (later merged in Japan Airlines) took delivery of the last new-built passenger A300, an A300-622R, in November 2002.
A300-600RF: (Official designation: A300F4-600R) The freighter version of the −600R. All A300s delivered between November 2002 and 12 July 2007 (last ever A300 delivery) were A300-600RFs.
Main article: Airbus A310
Introduced a shorter fuselage, a new, higher aspect ratio wing, smaller horizontal tail and two crew operation. It is available in standard −200 and the Extended range −300 with 9,600 km (5,965 mi) range in both passenger and full cargo versions.

It is also available as a military tanker/transport serving the Canadian Forces and German Air Force. Sales total 260, although five of these (ordered by Iraqi Airways) were never built.

Main article: Airbus Beluga
Commonly referred to as the Airbus Beluga or "Airbus Super Transporter," these five airframes are used by Airbus to ferry parts between the company's disparate manufacturing facilities, thus enabling workshare distribution. They replaced the four Aero Spacelines Super Guppys previously used by Airbus.


Wreckage of PIA Flight 268
As of September 2015, the A300 has been involved in 70 accidents and incidents, including 32 hull-losses and 1,435 fatalities.[12]

27 June 1976: Air France Flight 139, originating in Tel Aviv, Israel and carrying 248 passengers and a crew of 12 took off from Athens, Greece, headed for Paris, France. The flight was hijacked by terrorists, and was eventually flown to Entebbe Airport in Uganda. At the airport, Israeli commandos rescued 102 of the 105 hostages.
17 March 1982: Air France Flight 125, originating in San'a International, Yemen carrying 111 passengers and 13 crew aborted take off when an explosion in one engine was felt. Aircraft was declared a loss after the resulting fire. No fatalities.
18 December 1983: Malaysia Airlines Flight 684, an Airbus A300B4 leased from Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), registration OY-KAA, crashed short of the runway at Kuala Lumpur in bad weather while attempting to land on a flight from Singapore. All 247 persons aboard escaped unharmed but the aircraft was destroyed in the resulting fire.[13]
29 September 1986: Indian Airlines Flight 571 overran runway due to aborted takeoff. No fatalities.
21 September 1987: EgyptAir Airbus A300B4-203 touched down 700 m past the runway threshold. The right main gear hit runway lights and the aircraft collided with an antenna and fences. Five crew fatalities. No passengers.[14]
3 July 1988: Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down by the USS Vincennes in the Persian Gulf after being mistaken for an attacking Iranian F-14 Tomcat, killing all 290 passengers and crew.[15]
15 February 1991: two Kuwait Airways A300C4-620s and two Boeing 767s that had been seized during Iraq's occupation of Kuwait were destroyed in coalition bombing of Mosul Airport.[16]
28 September 1992: Pakistan International Airlines Flight 268, an A300B4 crashed on approach near Kathmandu, Nepal. All 12 crew and 155 passengers perished.[17]
24 April 1993: an Air Inter Airbus A300B2-1C was written off after colliding with a light pole while being pushed back at Montpellier.[18]
15 November 1993: Indian Airlines Flight 440 made an emergency landing in a field near Tirupati after running out of fuel. The plane had aborted a landing in poor visibility at Hyderabad and was unable to reach its alternate because of increased fuel consumption due to stuck flaps. No fatalities.[19]
26 April 1994: China Airlines Flight 140 (Taiwan) crashed at the end of runway at Nagoya, Japan, killing all 15 crew and 249 of 256 passengers on board.
24 December 1994: Air France Flight 8969 was hijacked at Houari Boumedienne Airport in Algiers, by four terrorists who belonged to the Armed Islamic Group. The terrorists apparently intended to crash the plane over the Eiffel Tower on Boxing Day. After a failed attempt to leave Marseille following a confrontational firefight between the terrorists and the GIGN French Special Forces, the result was the death of all four terrorists. (Snipers on the terminal front's roof shot dead two of the terrorists. The other two terrorists died as a result of gunshots in the cabin after approximately 20 minutes.) Three hostages including a Vietnamese diplomat were executed in Algiers, 229 hostages survived, many of them wounded by shrapnel. The almost 15-year-old aircraft was written off.
26 September 1997: Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 crashed while landing into Medan, Indonesia. all 234 passengers and crew aboard perished.
16 February 1998: China Airlines Flight 676 (Taiwan) crashed into residential area close to CKS international airport near Taipei, Taiwan. All 196 people on board were killed, including Taiwan's central bank president. Seven people on the ground were also killed.
24 December 1999: Indian Airlines Flight IC 814 from Kathmandu, Nepal, to New Delhi was hijacked to Kandahar, Afghanistan. There was one fatality.
12 November 2001: American Airlines Flight 587 crashed into the Belle Harbor neighbourhood of Queens, New York, United States shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport. The vertical stabilizer ripped off the aircraft after the rudder was mishandled during wake turbulence. All 260 people on board were killed, along with 5 people on the ground. It is the second-deadliest incident involving an A300 to date and the second-deadliest aircraft incident on United States soil.
22 November 2003: European Air Transport OO-DLL, operating on behalf of DHL Aviation, was hit by an SA-14 'Gremlin' missile after takeoff from Baghdad International Airport. The aeroplane lost hydraulic pressure and thus the controls. After extending the landing gear to create more drag, the crew piloted the plane using differences in engine thrust and landed the plane with minimal further damage. The plane was repaired and offered for sale, but in April 2011 it still remained parked at Baghdad Intl.[20]
1 March 2004, Pakistan International Airlines Flight 2002 burst 2 tires whilst taking off from King Abdulaziz International Airport. Fragments of the tire were ingested by the engines, this caused the engines to catch fire and an aborted takeoff was performed. Due to the fire substantial damage to the engine and the left wing caused the aircraft to be written off. All 261 passengers and 12 crew survived.[21]
14 April 2010: AeroUnion Flight 302, an A300B4-203F, crashed on a road 2 km short of the runway while attempting to land at Monterrey airport in Mexico. Seven people (five crew members and two on the ground) were killed.[22]
25 August 2011: an A300B4-620 5A-IAY of Afriqiyah Airways and A300B4-622 5A-DLZ of Libyan Arab Airlines were both destroyed in fighting between pro- and anti-Gadaffi forces at Tripoli International Airport.[23][24]
16 November 2012: A DHL Airbus A300 cargo aircraft bound for Bratislava crash-landed on its nose at 5:25 am at Bratislava airport M. R. S. (BTS) (Slovakia) after its front undercarriage failed. All three crew members survived.[25]
14 August 2013: UPS Flight 1354, an Airbus A300F4-622R, crashed outside the perimeter fence on approach to Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport in Birmingham, Alabama, United States. Both crew members died.[26]

            <Title>5: Descent</Title>
            <Text>I was in the First Class galley when the tail of the plane exploded.
You don’t have to see something like that happen to know that it did.  When there’s a sudden loud booming noise that reverb-fades into a howling wind just before your ears pop and you find that you can’t breathe too-cold air, well, what else could have happened?
The ground fell away from my feet and the bulkhead rushed sideways to meet my face.  I got my arms up in time, but I feel something snap in my right forearm before it stopped feeling anything.  A second later and someone was screaming into my ear.
“Lily!  Are you okay?”  My brain was working in reverse and I knew it was a she who was shaking me before I could come up with a name or face.  Pamela.  “Are? You? O? Kay?”  Each syllable was its own question, punctuated with other shake underlined with a jolt up my right arm.
I struggled to pull frozen razor-blade air into my lungs.
“Yeah.  I’m here.”
I’d barely gotten the first word out before she’d let me go and I heard the PA crackle to life.  It was only then that I noticed the steady increase in screaming.  People were waking up to not being able to breathe and everyone around them screaming.  What else were they going to do?
“OXYGEN MASKS!” came Pamela’s commanding voice over the PA.  She sounded like a drill sergeant, calm and direct, and I could barely focus my eyes on the wall a foot away.  “PUT ON YOUR MASK BEFORE HELPING THOSE AROUND YOU!”
My knees gave out and hit the floor.  Right.  Air.  Air would be good.
Pamela’s voice was in my ear again instead of the over PA.
“Lily, I need your help!”
She was manhandling me.  Doing something to my head.
A blast of stale something hit my face and the brain fog cleared.  Pamela was standing over me, ridiculous mask over her face, trying to wedge an elastic strap between my lolling head and the carpet.
“Lily!  Come on, girl!”
“I’m here.”  I shook my head to try to clear more cobwebs, but that made my vision go red.  “I’m here.”
“Can you stand?  Can? You? Stand?”
I closed my eyes, not wanting to think about how much this was going to hurt.
“Yeah.  I think so.  Help me up.”
I lost a second or two, but when my vision cleared I was on my feet.
“Can you hold this?”  Pamela was waving a small oxygen tank in front of me.  I was almost thinking straight again and realized the bottle was connected to my own mask.  She had another bottle in her hands.  She’d gotten the kits from storage and had thought to make us both portable, all while I was recovering from my introduction to the wall.  Holy cow, this woman had her stuff together.
“Yeah,” and I took it from her.
“I need to check,” she pointed forward, “on the pilots.   You,” she swept her arm toward the howling behind me, “need to help the passengers.  Get their masks on, and get them into crash positions.  I’ll come right back.”
I barely got out my “yeah” before she was already pulling herself along the galley bulkhead toward the cockpit.  Watching her crab-walk made me realize that something was wrong with gravity.  The floor wasn’t level.  There was a noticeable pitch from back to front, but there was also something pushing me into the wall.  I tried not to think about it and stepped to grab for the PA microphone.
“Listen—” the mask was getting in the way of the microphone.  I juggled them both, trying to also keep a hand on the wall.  I settled for pushing the mask up over my nose.
“LISTEN PLEASE.”  I didn’t yell, but I did my best to channel what my grandmother sounded like every time I got out of control.  “I NEED EVERYONE TO ASSUME CRASH POSITIONS.”  More than a few screams got louder as I said this.  “KEEP YOUR MASKS ON, CROSS YOUR ARMS,” I performed the maneuver as best I could with one arm glued to the bulkhead though it didn’t seem like anyone was watching, “AND BEND TO PUT YOUR HEAD ON YOUR KNEES.”  Heads ducked out of view and some of the screams were muffled.  “ARMS CROSSED.  HEAD ON YOUR KNEES.”
I dropped the microphone, not bothering to hang it back in its place.  I glanced back at the cockpit as its door slammed shut behind Pamela.
“They’re fine!  We need to help them!”  Her free hand waved toward the passengers.  “Together!”
I stretched out my right arm—I was now sure that wrist was fractured as it screamed at me when I tried to bend it—toward Pamela.  We locked elbows, reached for the back of the first row of seats, and hauled ourselves what felt like uphill.
As we passed each row we forcibly rolled people into crash positions.  Some passengers didn’t have masks, and they didn’t stir when we pulled their masks on for them.  I had a moment when I wanted to stop and shake them, but Pamela’s steady tug on my elbow kept me moving.
We passed into Coach, repeating the same words and procedures.  Masks, “ARMS CROSSED, HEAD ON YOUR KNEES”, and little pushes on the back of the head to send the message.
The farther back we went the more chaotic the scene became.  The howl of the wind grew louder, and even Pamela’s perfect hair started to whip in a halo around her head.
I was fine until we passed the divider between Smoking and Non, the curtains whipping the bent backs of the passengers in the first row.
Half of the tail was just … gone.
There was a hole that had to have been twelve or fifteen feet across.  I could see sky through it.  I can’t describe it, because I couldn’t wrap my head around it.  What was supposed to be there—rows of seating, people, overhead shelves with carry-on bags—was instead a dark and cloudy sky.
Pamela didn’t stop, but my arm went slack and we unlinked.  I watched her continue down the rows, unaffected by the sight.
My knees gave out a second time and hit the deck.  The pitch rolled me back against the divider and I couldn’t do anything but sit there.
I could feel my heart working faster and faster in my chest until the sound of my pulse in my ears drowned out even the shriek of the wind.
My fingers went numb and I lost what little grip I had on the divider.  I tried to bring my hands to my now-pounding temples, but they were uncontrollable weights on the ends of arms that were now too long and unwieldy to control.
The buzzing, percussive pounding in my head built until I didn’t think I could stand it and my eyes lost focus as I stared at the ceiling.
I couldn’t even form enough coherent thought to wonder what was happening to me.  I was dying.  We were all dying.  What else was there?</Text>

The Ilyushin Il-86 (Russian: Илью́шин Ил-86; NATO reporting name: Camber) is a short/medium-range wide-body jet airliner. It was the USSR's first wide-body and the world's second four-engined wide-body. Designed and tested by the Ilyushin design bureau in the 1970s, it was certified by the Soviet aircraft industry, manufactured and marketed by the USSR.

The Il-86 was the penultimate Soviet-era airliner to be designed (preceding its sister model the Il-96, which first flew in 1988). Developed during the Leonid Brezhnev era, which was marked by stagnation in many sectors of Soviet industry, the Il-86 used engines more typical of the 1960s, spent a decade in development, and failed to enter service in time for the Moscow Olympics, as was originally intended. The type was used by Aeroflot and successor post-Soviet airlines and only three of the total 106 examples were exported. In service, it gained recognition as a very safe and reliable model with no fatal incidents during three decades of passenger-carrying operations.[2]

At the beginning of 2012, only four Il-86s remained in service, all with the Russian Air Force.[1]

In the mid-1960s, the USA and Western Europe planned airliners seating twice the then-maximum of some 200 passengers. They were known as airbuses at the time. The Soviet leadership wanted to match them with an aerobus (Russian: аэробус). Alongside the propaganda motive, the USSR genuinely needed an aerobus. Aeroflot expected over 100 million passengers a year[3] within a decade (the 100th million annual passenger was indeed carried on 29 December 1976.[4])

First to respond was OKB-153, the bureau led by Oleg Antonov. It proposed a 724-seat version of the An-22 airlifter.[5] The project was promoted until 1969, ultimately with a 605-passenger interior (383 on the upper deck and 223 on the lower).[6] It did not go ahead due to fears that it would be old-fashioned and because the Kiev-based bureau was close to the deposed Nikita Khrushchev.[7][8]

Many airports had terminals too small for "aerobuses".[9] In the West, the solution to this involved constructing greater airport capacity.[10] By contrast, Soviet aviation research institutes addressed ways of increasing passenger throughput without the need for additional airport capacity.

Many Soviet airports also had surfaces too weak for "aerobuses". The Soviet solution again favoured adapting aircraft to existing conditions, rather than reconstructing airports. The aerobus thus had to match the ground loadings of existing airliners. This called for complex multi-wheel landing gear.[11]

The Soviet solution to the airport capacity issue involved passengers loading and unloading their own luggage into and from the aircraft. This was eventually called "the luggage at hand system" (Russian: "система «багаж с собой»"; transliterated: "sistyema bagazh s soboy").[12] Soviet aviation journalist Kim Bakshmi described it (at its ultimate) thus: "One arrives five minutes prior to departure, buys oneself a ticket on board the aircraft, hangs one's coat next to the seat and places one's bag or suitcase nearby.".[13]

Taking suitcases into the cabin, as in trains, was studied, but necessitated a 3 m fuselage extension with a 350-seat capacity.[14] To avoid this, passengers were to deposit their luggage in underfloor compartments as they entered the airliner.

Ideas similar to the "luggage at hand system" were briefly addressed in the West. Airbus studied such an arrangement in the mid-1970s.[15] Lockheed implemented it into the L-1011 TriStar in 1973 at the request of Pacific Southwest Airlines (who used the baggage compartment as an entertainment lounge) and possibly also to suit potential Soviet buyers (see below).[16]

In October 1967, the Soviet government approved a Ministry of Civil Aviation (Aeroflot) specification for an aerobus. This called for 350 seats and a range of 3,600 km (1,900 nmis) with a 40-tonne payload or 5,800 km/3,100 nmi with seats taken but no freight. The airliner had to operate from smaller airports (classified as Klass "B" and "V" [Russian: класс "Б", "В"] or "Class B/C" by the Soviets) 2,600 m (8,500 ft) runways.[17]

In the second half of the 1960s, OKB-240 (as the Ilyushin bureau was formally known) was restoring positions lost (with Yakovlev, in favour of Tupolev and Antonov) during the Khrushchev era[18] and was well placed to secure design of the aerobus. When the Soviet cabinet's defence industry committee promoted the Aeroflot specification on September 8, 1969 to a preliminary project, (Russian: аванпроект; transliterated: avanproyekt),[19] it entrusted it to Ilyushin. The bureau received specific operational requirements for the aerobus on February 22, 1970.

In developing the concept which had been agreed, Ilyushin faced four challenges: configuration (layout or "shape"), powerplant, automation (avionics) and manufacturing capacity.

Ilyushin began work on the aerobus in late 1969, initially by assessing the development potential of existing aircraft. An enlarged Il-62 (the Il-62-250) would have had a 30-tonne payload, 259 seats and a 6.8 metre/22 ft longer fuselage:[14] a virtual analogue of the Douglas DC-8 "Super Sixty" series. Other proposed Il-62 modifications involved double-deck and "two fuselages side-by-side" developments. There was also a project to "civilianise" the Il-76.

From March 1970[20] the bureau developed all-new designs under the Il-86 designation. Instead of the "appropriate technology" approach of the Il-62, these designs were to have powered controls, complex high-lift devices and advanced automation which would reduce the number of flightdeck crew.[21]

An early avanproyekt was shown to the Soviet leadership at an exhibition of civil aviation innovations at Vnukovo-2 Airport near Moscow on May 17, 1971.[22][23][24] A scale model with the designation of "Il-86" showed the "self-loading" concept with integral boarding stairs, below-deck luggage stores, and below-deck midships galley. It had a twin-aisle interior with nine-abreast seating in a "3-3-3" layout. Ilyushin considered it politic to make the interior wider than any planned airliner except the Boeing 747.[25] The 6.07 m (19.9 ft) fuselage diameter was partly dictated by the need to provide standing room in the underfloor luggage compartments. The Il-86 had the second-widest fuselage of any airliner until the Boeing 777.

On this basis, on 9 March 1972,[26] the bureau was asked to proceed with detailed design. The difference between the 1971 model and the eventual Il-86 was in configuration: the model had looked like an Il-62. At that time, the Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute (TsAGI) favoured the clean-winged, rear-engined, T-tailed configuration for airliners. The BAC Three-Eleven[27] and BAC/CASA/MBB Europlane[28] projects had similar configurations.

The configuration of heavy jet aircraft was a politically sensitive issue in the USSR. Aircraft designer Leonid Selyakov[29] states this of the underwing-engine US-pioneered layout which gradually became standard for jet airliners: "The configuration of the В-47, taken on strength by the US Air Force ... brought forth a veritable storm of critical opinions from [Soviet] aviation scientists. Responsible TsAGI officials and industry leaders robustly called that aircraft 'utter nonsense' (similar opinions were expressed of the Boeing 747)."

Similar controversies were known in Western aeronautical circles[30] but typified Soviet dogmatism which held that problems had immutable, "scientifically-correct" solutions.[31]

Ilyushin therefore had to stress that it had first in the world used podded engines suspended from pylons beneath and ahead of the wing, on the experimental Ilyushin Il-22 four-engined jet bomber of 1946 (first use of this designation).[32] Having thus been presented the Il-86's ultimate configuration as indigenously Soviet, the bureau could at last show it in public in 1973, six years after publication of the aerobus specification and four years after the design assignment.[33][34] A modern six-window flightdeck followed, in place of the 18-to-20 window glazing of the Il-18, Il-62 and Il-76.

The main problem facing the Il-86 project was the lack of a suitable engine. It was never resolved. By the close of the 1960s, the USA and the UK had turbofans with bypass ratios of 4 or 5 to 1. The first Soviet large turbofan, the Lotarev D-18T, did not appear before the mid-1980s.[35] The Soloviev D-30, originally intended for the Il-86, was the most advanced Soviet civil aeroengine. It had a bypass ratio of 2.4 to 1 and aerodynamic clamshell thrust reversers. It failed to attain the required thrust, however: "only after the lapse of three years that were spent on preparing the advanced development project did it become clear that these engines would not provide the necessary take-off performance."[36] The less-advanced Kuznetsov NK-8 series engine, adopted on March 26, 1975, had a bypass ratio of 1.15 to 1 and drag-inducing grilles over its cascade thrust reversers. Both these engines had high specific fuel consumptions and were noisy. Being ultimate developments of smaller engines, they could not offer growth to future Il-86s.

The appropriate/intermediate technology principles to which most Soviet airliners before the Il-86 had been designed meant that they had typically five-member flight crews. The design and entry into service in 1972 of the Tu-154, an airliner built to high technology principles (more automation, less human input), showed that Soviet science lagged behind in the development of avionics which would remove the need for navigators and radio operators. A programme of avionics development was mounted to enable the Il-86 to operate in most weathers with a three-member flight crew, matching Western technology of the time.

The shortage of manufacturing facilities for the Il-86 was a problem from the outset: "The rapid modernisation of the Soviet Air Force ... has left limited scope for the expansion of commercial production ... the lack of production capacity is being remedied partly by ... international cooperation."[37] This meant involving the Polish aircraft industry in the project.

The Soviets tried to import technology to solve the powerplant (and to an extent the avionics and manufacturing capacity) issues. The attempts took two directions. First was wholesale technology transfer similar to the Li-2 deal of the 1930s. This would have delayed Il-86 development, since the programme would have been demoted to a reserve status. The second direction was to import individual systems and items. This would have speeded Il-86 development. The fact that Il-86 development was protracted indicates that for long periods the programme was pursued as backup insurance in case wholesale technology transfer failed.

Before the Boeing 747 had flown, a Ministry of Civil Aviation delegation visited the USA for a series of detailed sales presentations on the type lasting three days. At the 1971 Paris Salon, Ilyushin bureau head Genrikh Novozhilov and Boeing's Joe Sutter are claimed to have arranged an informal technology trade-off. Over supper in a Paris restaurant, the Soviet side ceded information on titanium technology to the Americans, while the latter, "sketching on the tablecloth," ceded information on pylon-mounted podded engines and "the structural and aerodynamic amity of the aeroelastic wing."[38][39] Soviet interest in buying the 747s continued until the end of détente in the late 1970s.[40]

At the peak of détente, on March 11, 1974, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar arrived in Moscow for three days of sales presentations and demonstrations.[41][42] The TriStar matched the Il-86 in size and performance and had development potential. Negotiations to buy 30 TriStars of the L-1011-385-250 version and licence-produce up to 100 a year in a new factory employing 80,000 people[37] continued until mid-1976.[43] Any residual will to export TriStars was scotched when US President Jimmy Carter made human rights a US foreign policy factor. TriStar exports would have needed Coordinating Committee clearance: the type embodied advanced technology banned from potential enemies. In 1978, the US Department of Commerce vetoed export of 12 General Electric CF6-50 engines ordered by the USSR for planned long-range Il-86s.[44]

By analogy with other aircraft programmes,[45] a third direction in the efforts to acquire foreign technology may have involved illicit action along the lines of the reverse engineering of the Tu-4 from the B-29 and the copying of the Rolls-Royce Nene jet engine as the Klimov VK-1. Oblique reference to this comes in an account of the An-124 by the then-powerplant head of the Antonov bureau, V. G. Anisyenko: "The MAP leadership wanted to have a uniform large engine also capable of civil aviation applications, such as the Il-86. The most suitable analogue from this viewpoint was considered to be the Rolls-Royce RB.211-22. To purchase it, in 1976 a MAP procurement party went to Great Britain, headed by engine construction deputy minister Dondukov ... Our ultimate task was to copy the RB.211-22, for which purpose we had to buy not fewer than eight examples ... The English ... would only sell us the engine in quantities ... to power no fewer than 100 aircraft. As a result, we did not get a sample ... "[46]

The design process at Ilyushin was managed by Sergey Ilyushin's successor as head of the bureau, Genrikh Novozhilov. The timescale announced in 1973 envisaged first flight in 1976 and service entry in time for the Moscow Olympics in 1980.

The prototype flew at Khodynka airfield (where Ilyushin's experimental factory was) on December 22, 1976 (Soviet airliners often flew before the close of calendar years due to the requirements of Five-Year Plans). It was announced that the type had a patented electromagnetic pulse deicing system.[47][48] which used 500 times less energy than conventional deicers.[49] It is claimed that over 50 new technological processes were introduced into Soviet practice as a result of the Il-86 programme.[50]

The initial test programme was flown by Ilyushin staff, ending two months ahead of schedule on October 20, 1978. Other sources claim that these tests were completed on 22 September 1978.[14][51] (According to a faster schedule announced at the time of the first flight, Ilyushin tests were to have ended in time for the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution on November 7, 1977.[52]) In-house testing involved speeds up to Mach 0.93 and bank angles up to 11 degrees greater than specified.

Initial certification flying by pilots independent of Ilyushin ended on June 6, 1977. State acceptance trials began on April 24, 1979 and ended on December 24, 1980. Certification by Gosaviaregistr SSSR [the USSR State Aviation Registry] was granted under certificate number 10-86.[53] The Il-86 entered Aeroflot service on 26 December the same year.[54] The service-entry deadline of summer 1980, announced by Minister of Civil Aviation Boris Bugayev in 1977[55] had passed, however, and the Il-86 missed the Moscow Olympics in the summer of 1980.

Overall development of the Il-86 occupied over a decade. The length of this period was due to the sensitivity of the airliner's configuration, problems with its powerplant, prolonged avionics development and the low priority of civil as opposed to military aircraft.[56] In its earlier stages, the Il-86 programme was also held back by hopes of US airliner imports. Certificating the Il-86 to the very demanding set of Soviet and Comecon standards called NLGS-2 also delayed progress; it was the first Soviet aircraft to undergo a full certification programme since certification was introduced in the USSR in 1967 and became mandatory five years later.[57]

Production of the Il-86 began in late 1976 and continued until mid 1995. There was no prototype. The first two machines were handmade by Ilyushin at the bureau's own Moscow facility in 1976 and 1977. One was used for flight testing and the other for static ground testing.

Beyond these initial examples, Ministry of Aircraft Manufacture ("MAP," "Minaviaprom") Factory 64 at Voronezh (today VASO) was tasked with building more than half of each Il-86 and performing final assembly.[58] Three aircraft were assembled at Voronezh by 1979. The first (flown on October 25, 1977) was built largely by hand, subsequent machines making increasing use of production equipment. These aircraft were used in certification and development flying before handover to Aeroflot.[59] Voronezh factory production engineers conducted a "redesign cycle"[60] of over 50 areas, cutting some 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) of airframe weight.

Capacity at Voronezh was insufficient and the Polish aircraft industry was involved in the Il-86 project from the start. The arrangement involved significant technology transfer to Poland: PZL Amalgamation Mielec factory Director Jerzy Belczak said it involved “… a radical retooling of our enterprise” involving “over 50 new processes.”[61] Observers noted that "work on the Il-86 will bring Poland's ... WSK-Mielec to a new level of capability ... in the manufacturing processes involved with an aircraft of this size, including titanium structures, chemical milling and the machining of integral panels."[62]

By the mid-1980s, PZL was planned to produce half of the Il-86,[63] including the entire wing, and also to work on Il-86 developments (“Now we are preparing to manufacture units for the next model of the Il wide-body plane,” according to Belczak).[64] From May 1977, the Polish factory manufactured entire empennages including tailplanes and the fin, all control surfaces, high-lift devices and engine pylons for the Il-86, representing "about 16 per cent of these aircraft."[65] Amid labour and political unrest in Poland from 1980 onwards, the Voronezh factory was instructed to retain wing manufacture.

After certification in 1980, annual Il-86 outputs were: 1980, 1; 1981, 0; 1982, 11; 1983, 12; 1984, 8; 1985, 9 (including the four for 8 ADON); 1986, 11; 1987, 10; 1988, 10; 1989, 9; 1990, 11 (including the three for export to China), 1991, 3.[66] Of the 106 examples built, one never flew (being used for static tests) and three were exported.[67]

The Five-Year Plan in force when the USSR ceased to exist called for 40 more aircraft to be manufactured by 1995, but the manufacturing facility closed in early 1992.[68]

All-metal low-wing land monoplane with four wing-mounted jet engines.[69][70][71][72]

Cantilever three-spar structure of modified trapezoid planform. Centre section integral with fuselage. Inboard sections, outboard sections and detachable leading and trailing edges. High-lift devices comprise full-span six-segment leading edge slats (contiguous at engine pylons) at up to 17.5% of chord (drooping to 35°), two-segment fixed-vane double-slotted trailing edge flaps occupying some 75% of the span (deploying to 40°) and five-segment spoilers (outboards used as spoilerons at high speeds, inboards used as lift dumpers on the ground). Two-segment outboard ailerons for low speed roll control. Boundary layer fences over pylons. Engines suspended from the wing on pylons act as anti-flutter weights. Trim range is 16–33% of mean aerodynamic chord.

Circular-section structure of frames and stringers with a continuous main deck and lower decks fore and aft of the centre section. Rectangular windows in most interframe bays, eight ICAO Type 1a passenger doors on the main deck and three more on the lower deck portside; two freight hold doors and a galley supply door on the lower deck starboard. The main deck houses the flightdeck, two wardrobes, eight toilets, two pantries and a three-section passenger cabin. The lower deck houses three entry vestibules/luggage stores with hydraulic boarding stairs to ground level and fixed stairs to the main deck, a midships galley linked with the main deck by an electric lift, two freight holds (fore and aft of the passenger facilities), an avionics bay and two technical bays. The entire accommodation is pressurised and air-conditioned with "earphones for music or on-board cinema."[73][74]

Cantilevered trapezoid planform swept-back surfaces. Two-segment elevators and rudder. Tailplane area 96.5 m2 (1,039 ft2); incidence adjustable between 2° and 12° by electric motors commanded by yoke trim thumbwheels and console trim wheels. Fin area 56.06 m2 (603.4 ft2). Landing gear of near-conventional layout, with a twin-wheeled nose leg and three four-wheel bogie main gear legs (centreline and two outers). Track is 9.9 m (/32 ft 5.5 in).

Four Kuznetsov NK-86 two-spool with five-stage LP compressors, six-stage HP compressors, annular combustor cans, single-stage HP turbine and two-stage LP turbine turbofan engines power the Il-86. The cascade thrust reversers are canted 15° in respect to the horizontal axis. Pneumatic starters start the engines (airborne relights use the windmill effect). The forward-facing ejectors blow away detritus during taxi. International Standard Atmosphere hourly fuel consumption per engine is 7.7 t (16,975 lb) at maximum continuous rated thrust, 6 t/13,230 lb at nominal maximum thrust, 5.1 t (11,243 lb) at 85% thrust, 4.2 t/9260 lb at 70%, 3.6 t (7,937 lb) at 60%, 2.45 t (5,400 lb) at 40% and 1 t (2,205 lb) at idle. Overall hourly fuel consumption at long-range cruise and 190 t (419,000 lb) is 9.75 t (21,495 lb) reducing to 7.79 t (17,174 lb) at 140 t (308,650 lb). Outboard engine pylons on the latter two-thirds of all Il-86s are marginally extended to cut drag.

The VSU-10 APU generates power and heats/cools the interior on the ground, and provides engine start air.

Hydraulically driven. An SAU-1T-2 automatic flight control system offers assisted manual or automatic flight, with no manual option. Four independent hydraulic systems power all flight controls and the built-in airstairs. Fluid is to the NGZh, rather than AMG, formula.

Pizhma-1 navigational system with OMEGA inputs. GPS transceivers and a TCAS fitted retroactively during the 1990s. Pizhma-1 can be used throughout the flight from departure terminal area to landing and taxi to stand. Pizhma-1 has full-time roll and yaw dampers.

Airfield approach aids enable instrument landing system-coupled approaches to ICAO Category II weather minima.

Other radio aids include VOR and DME receivers, a weather radar, and Warsaw Pact identification aids. Cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders standard.

Four GT-40PCh6 engine generators generate energy from the Kuznetsov NK-86. The APU or ground sources supply 200/115 V, 400 Hz current to the primary system or two secondary systems (36 V/400 Hz AC and 27 V DC). Recipients include high-lift devices, tailplane trim, deicing, galley lift (elevator) and interior services.

The expected service life of an Il-86 is twenty years (up to 25) or 10,000 landings( from 20,000 up to 35,000 hours) prior to major servicing.[75]

An inaugural service from Moscow to Tashkent was flown on December 26, 1980 but services-proper commenced after February 1, 1981. Aeroflot first operated the Il-86 on peak domestic routes. Foreign services began in June 1981 to Eastern Europe. Services to larger West European cities began with the winter timetable starting in October that year.[76] Charter flights to European points followed, with services on high-density medium/long-range routes within the Soviet Union coming last.

Although the Il-86 was a medium-range airliner, from 1982 Aeroflot put it into scheduled service from Moscow to Havana via Shannon and Gander, "perhaps with limited payload or with additional tankerage."[77] Other scheduled long-range services flown by the type were to Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Lima, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, all via Sal Island.


A Siberia Airlines Il-86 takes off from Tivat Airport (2007).
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, national airlines emerged in the 15 successor republics. Il-86s serving with Aeroflot administrations ("Directorates") in these nations accrued to their airlines and many were traded.

From April 2002, the European Union, the USA and much of the rest of the world banned noisier aircraft, including the Il-86. On October 23, 2006, Aeroflot Deputy Director General Igor Desyatnichenko said that the Il-86 was to be withdrawn from service starting November 15 that year as it operated for just two or three months in the summer."[78]

The Il-86's "luggage at hand" carry-on luggage facility was rarely used.[79] Vul'fov (ibid.) notes: "Thank God no civil servant got it into his head to refuse the parallel opportunity offered to passengers of electing to drop their luggage when checking-in at airports. Otherwise, the loading of luggage into the aircraft by passengers would have turned into a proper nightmare lasting hours."

In 1987 Radio Moscow reported that Aeroflot "resisted the change" to a three-person crew.[80][81] Vul'fov, A, ibid., reports that the type continued to be operated by four-member crews. Navigators, occupying the observer seat (devoid of instrumentation), stood unsecured on final approach to oversee the pilots' instruments and read-out indications (despite voice synthesizers being fitted). Soviet operations of the Tu-154 airliner similarly employed four or five flightdeck crew, despite foreign operators using three-person flightdeck crews.


Il-86VKP in August 2012
With its built-in stairs and below deck holds, the Il-86 was widely expected to serve in the personnel transport role with the Soviet air forces: "The wide-bodied Il-86 can perform not only as a troop transport ... but may also in the future form the basis for a command and control aircraft for airborne coordination of Warsaw Pact forces."[82]

In the event, four airframes (c/n 042, 043, 046 and 048, carrying quasi-civil registrations SSSR-86146, '7, '8 and '9) were delivered to the 8th Special Purposes Aviation Division at the Chkalovsky air base near Moscow. These are variously claimed to be designated Il-80, Il-82, Il-87 or Il-86VKP (Russian: “ВКП” for “воздушный командный пост”; transliterated: "vozdushniy komandnyi post" “veh-kah-peh” and meaning "aerial command post"). This version has the NATO reporting name Maxdome.

Il-86 provision to Aeroflot did not constitute a sale: it was part of the centralised Soviet supply and allocation system coordinated by offices called Gosplan and Gossnab which controlled the entirety of planning and distribution in the USSR (except the black market). Built aircraft were allocated to Aeroflot regions and Soviet Air Force units as follows (in order of first acceptance): the Vnukovo Aviation Entreprise, 21; the TsUMVS Administration of International Air Communications centred on Sheremetyevo Airport, 22; the Tashkent Air Enterprise, 9; the Sheremetyevo Air Enterprise, 10; the Pulkovo Air Enterprise, 8; the Alma-Ata Air Enterprise, 8; the Chkalovsky Soviet Air Force Base 8 ADON (or 8th Special Purposes Aviation Division), 4; the Kol'tsovo Air Enterprise, 6; the Tolmachevo Air Enterprise, 6; the Erevan Air Enterprise, 2; the Yemelyanovo Air Enterprise, 3.[83]

Selling the Il-86 commercially (which under the Soviet system meant solely exports) was the job of the Soviet foreign trade organisation V/O Aviaeksport. The division of responsibilities between the influential TsAGI research establishment, design bureaux (acting like naval architects) which designed aeroplanes, factories (independent of the bureaux) which constructed them, independent service facilities which repaired them and an independent organisation which marketed them alongside designs by all other bureaux, has been seen as diluting responsibility for the fate of a product.[84]

As part of supply provisions within the Comecon, Lot was allocated four Il-86s as barter for component manufacture; the airline deferred deliveries which were cancelled by 1987.[85] In 1988 the East German airline Interflug is said to have prepared to take delivery of two Il-86s and to have allocated them the registrations DDR-AAA and DDR-AAB. Instead, that same year the airline took delivery of two Airbus A310s.[86] The sole export order for the Il-86 − and the sole commercial transactions involving factory-built rather than secondhand examples − was by China Xinjiang Airlines which received three aircraft in 1990.

The Il-86 prototype was displayed at the Paris Salon International de l'Aéronautique in 1977. It was noted that its interior used patented fire-resistant materials and hydraulics employed a fire-resistant fluid.[87] At that time a version without the "luggage at hand" system was offered, seating 375 or alternatively weighing 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) less and having longer range. This version offered 7% lower seat-mile operational costs.[88] The type was again displayed at Paris in 1979, 1981, 1983 and 1985, the Farnborough Air Show in 1984 and other world air events.

Setting records was a traditional Soviet way of promoting aviation products.[citation needed] On Tuesday September 22, 1981, an Il-86 flown by Commander G Volokhov and Second Pilot A Tyuryumin set Fédération Aéronautique Internationale records for flying payloads of 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 and 65 tonnes over a 2,000 km closed circuit at an average of 975.3 km per hour.[89] Two days later, the same crew and machine set FAI records for flying payloads of 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 and 80-tonne payloads over a 1,000 km closed circuit at an average of 962 km/h.[90] Of these 18 records, one was broken by a Tu-144 in 1983, five were superseded or discontinued and 12 still stood in 2010.

In September 1982 the type made a sales call on Bulgaria, followed by calls in July 1983 on Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Potential buyers received no hard information on the type in advance.[91] Little solid information was given during the sales calls: "constructor Novosilov sidestepped all questions [on fuel consumption] ... [the] chief pilot ... provided a measure of veiled explanation: 'The consumption of the Il-86 is not higher than that of the Il-18,' he said." While welcomed as “proof of friendship with the USSR,”[92] these sales calls failed to attract orders. Observers tacitly noted that the aircraft marked a 10/15-year lag by Soviet civil aviation compared with the West.

Only the base version of the Il-86 and a small batch of military derivatives entered service. Further versions were mooted but none entered service. Freight or combined passenger-freight versions are not known to have been proposed.

On June 26, 1972, a long-range version of the Il-86, the Il-86D (for Russian: "дальний"; transliterated: "dal’niy"; meaning "long-range"), was ordered into development by the Soviet cabinet. Design was completed in June 1976. The Il-86D would have had a marginally extended wing span, carried additional fuel, and had a range of some 8,500 km (4,600 nmi). Later announcements stated that a version of the Il-86D with Lotarev D-18 engines had entered development in March 1975.[93] This version would have had a 147,500 kg (325,000 lb) empty weight, a 300,000 kg/660,000 lb maximum take-off weight, a fuel capacity of some 150,000 kg (330,000 lb), a wing area of 325 m2 (5,300 ft2), and a range of 10,200 km (5,500 nmi). It evolved into the Il-96.

A "minimum-change" development of the Il-86, stated to have been designated Il-86V, was test-flown on 1 June 1982 and was ready for service by 27 April 1985. It was said to have 450 seats, with the underfloor vestibules fitted with seats and possible changes to main-deck seating.[94] The version is not known to have entered passenger service but may have been used by the military.[93]

In the 1980s, there were moves to fit the Il-86 with RB211-22 engines.[95] Designated Il-86V (second use of this designation), this would have had a range of over 9,000 km (4,860 nmi) and/or increased payload. Another 450-seater Il-86V powered by RB211-524G engines was also projected. Amid the disintegration of the Soviet economy, these versions did not progress.

In 1991, there were moves to fit the Il-86 with Franco-American CFM56-5C2 engines.[96] Finances precluded progress. In 1995, International Aero Engines offered the V2500 engine to five Il-86 operators with proposals to re-engine 25 aircraft.[97][98] The offer was not taken up.

As of August 2013, the Il-86 is known to have been involved in at least 10 incidents, including 4 hull-loss accidents with 14 fatalities.[101] There were no incidents nor accidents involving an Il-86 that resulted in passenger deaths in over 30 years of the type's passenger-carrying operations.

The following are reported significant recorded safety events involving the Il-86:

On an unknown date during the 1980s, an unknown Il-86 on approach to Mineralnye Vody, Russia, suffered a hydraulic failure resulting in asymmetrical deployment of the high-lift devices. The flight crew brought the machine to a safe landing without further incident. No casualties.
On an unknown date in 1980, the aircraft registered SSSR-86004 (constructor's number 51483200002 ["002"]) experienced a fire in engine No 4 on departure from Vnukovo on an acceptance testing flight; the crew initially shut down No 1 in error, then No 4, but landed safely on the reciprocal runway to the one from which they had departed, after performing a 180° turn. No casualties. The investigation into this fire resulted in a modification to the engine.[102]
In 1984, SSSR-86011 (c/n 009) was found to have suffered a tail strike on landing at Simferopol.[103] No casualties.
On March 8, 1994, RA-86119 (c/n 087) parked at Delhi airport was struck by a landing Sahara India Boeing 737 (VT-SIA) flown by a trainee; both aircraft were destroyed. All 4 crew on the 737 were killed.[104] Two Aeroflot employees, a Russian ground engineer and an airport worker were killed on the ground.[105]
In June 1998, RA-86080 (c/n 051) was found to have been overstressed, most likely by a recent heavy landing, and repairs were considered inexpedient in view of coming retirement. No casualties; aircraft stored pending retirement.
On May 1, 2000, RA-86113 (c/n 081) suffered an apparent engine failure and fire on departure from Sochi. The flight crew brought the machine to a safe overweight landing. The failure and fire indications were found to have been spurious. No casualties.
On August 26, 2000, RA-86066 (c/n 033) experienced a failure and fire in No 2 engine shortly after take-off from Moscow Sheremetyevo for Barcelona. The crew landed on the reciprocal runway with no further incident. No casualties.
On September 21, 2001, RA-86074 (c/n 041) belly-landed at Dubai after a flight from Moscow, the flight crew having switched off the ground proximity warning due to heavy workload on the approach and then neglected to extend the landing gear; no casualties; aircraft written off.[106]
On July 28, 2002, RA-86060 (c/n 027) crashed shortly after departure from Moscow on a repositioning flight to Saint Peterburg. The trim toggle button on the control column caused a spontaneous retrimming of the tailplane, rapid transition to nose-heavy trim and a dive. The four flightdeck crew, two ground support staff and ten cabin crew aboard the aircraft died. The two injured survivors were cabin crew members.[107][108][109][110]
Following the Moscow crash in July 2002, the MAK Interstate Aviation Committee withdrew the Il-86's certificate of airworthiness, temporarily grounding the type. The certificate was rapidly restored in stages by early 2003.[111] The accident prompted the Egyptian civil aviation authorities to attempt to ban Il-86 operations to Egypt. Amid continuing negotiations, by 2007 the intention had lapsed, with intensive Il-86 operations to and from Egypt continuing.[112]

Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter
The Boeing 747 is a wide-body commercial jet airliner and cargo aircraft, often referred to by its original nickname, Jumbo Jet, or Queen of the Skies. Its distinctive "hump" upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft makes it among the world's most recognizable aircraft,[5] and it was the first wide-body produced. Manufactured by Boeing's Commercial Airplane unit in the United States, the original version of the 747 had two and a half times greater capacity than the Boeing 707,[6] one of the common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s. First flown commercially in 1970, the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years.[7]

The four-engine 747 uses a double deck configuration for part of its length. It is available in passenger, freighter and other versions. Boeing designed the 747's hump-like upper deck to serve as a first class lounge or extra seating, and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door. Boeing did so because the company expected supersonic airliners (development of which was announced in the early 1960s) to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete, while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would be robust well into the future.[8] The 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold,[9] but it exceeded critics' expectations with production passing the 1,000 mark in 1993.[10] By August 2015, 1,512 aircraft had been built, with 29 of the 747-8 variants remaining on order.[3]

The 747-400, the most common passenger version in service, has a high-subsonic cruise speed of Mach 0.85–0.855 (up to 570 mph or 920 km/h) with an intercontinental range of 7,260 nautical miles (8,350 mi or 13,450 km).[11] The 747-400 passenger version can accommodate 416 passengers in a typical three-class layout, 524 passengers in a typical two-class layout, or 660 passengers in a high density one-class configuration.[12] The newest version of the aircraft, the 747-8, is in production and received certification in 2011. Deliveries of the 747-8F freighter version to launch customer Cargolux began in October 2011; deliveries of the 747-8I passenger version to Lufthansa began in May 2012. The 747 is to be replaced by the Boeing Y3 (part of the Boeing Yellowstone Project) in the future.

In 1963, the United States Air Force started a series of study projects on a very large strategic transport aircraft. Although the C-141 Starlifter was being introduced, they believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed, especially the capability to carry outsized cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft. These studies led to initial requirements for the CX-Heavy Logistics System (CX-HLS) in March 1964 for an aircraft with a load capacity of 180,000 pounds (81,600 kg) and a speed of Mach 0.75 (500 mph or 805 km/h), and an unrefueled range of 5,000 nautical miles (9,260 km) with a payload of 115,000 pounds (52,200 kg). The payload bay had to be 17 feet (5.18 m) wide by 13.5 feet (4.11 m) high and 100 feet (30.5 m) long with access through doors at the front and rear.[13]

Featuring only four engines, the design also required new engine designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy. On May 18, 1964, airframe proposals arrived from Boeing, Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed and Martin Marietta; while engine proposals were submitted by General Electric, Curtiss-Wright, and Pratt &amp; Whitney. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed were given additional study contracts for the airframe, along with General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney for the engines.[13]

All three of the airframe proposals shared a number of features. As the CX-HLS needed to be able to be loaded from the front, a door had to be included where the cockpit usually was. All of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area; Douglas had a small "pod" just forward and above the wing, Lockheed used a long "spine" running the length of the aircraft with the wing spar passing through it, while Boeing blended the two, with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the wing.[14] In 1965 Lockheed's aircraft design and General Electric's engine design were selected for the new C-5 Galaxy transport, which was the largest military aircraft in the world at the time.[13] The nose door and raised cockpit concepts would be carried over to the design of the 747.[15]

The 747 was conceived while air travel was increasing in the 1960s.[16] The era of commercial jet transportation, led by the enormous popularity of the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, had revolutionized long-distance travel.[16][17] Even before it lost the CX-HLS contract, Boeing was pressed by Juan Trippe, president of Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), one of their most important airline customers, to build a passenger aircraft more than twice the size of the 707. During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft, became a problem that Trippe thought could be addressed by a large new aircraft.[18]

In 1965, Joe Sutter was transferred from Boeing's 737 development team to manage the design studies for a new airliner, already assigned the model number 747.[19] Sutter initiated a design study with Pan Am and other airlines, to better understand their requirements. At the time, it was widely thought that the 747 would eventually be superseded by supersonic transport aircraft.[20] Boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could be adapted easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined. In the freighter role, the clear need was to support the containerized shipping methodologies that were being widely introduced at about the same time. Standard containers are 8 ft (2.4 m) square at the front (slightly higher due to attachment points) and available in 20 and 40 ft (6.1 and 12 m) lengths. This meant that it would be possible to support a 2-wide 2-high stack of containers two or three ranks deep with a fuselage size similar to the earlier CX-HLS project.

In April 1966, Pan Am ordered 25 747-100 aircraft for US$525 million. During the ceremonial 747 contract-signing banquet in Seattle on Boeing's 50th Anniversary, Juan Trippe predicted that the 747 would be "... a great weapon for peace, competing with intercontinental missiles for mankind's destiny".[21] As launch customer,[1][22] and because of its early involvement before placing a formal order, Pan Am was able to influence the design and development of the 747 to an extent unmatched by a single airline before or since.[23]

Ultimately, the high-winged CX-HLS Boeing design was not used for the 747, although technologies developed for their bid had an influence.[24] The original design included a full-length double-deck fuselage with eight-across seating and two aisles on the lower deck and seven-across seating and two aisles on the upper deck.[25] However, concern over evacuation routes and limited cargo-carrying capability caused this idea to be scrapped in early 1966 in favor of a wider single deck design.[1] The cockpit was, therefore, placed on a shortened upper deck so that a freight-loading door could be included in the nose cone; this design feature produced the 747's distinctive "bulge".[26] In early models it was not clear what to do with the small space in the pod behind the cockpit, and this was initially specified as a "lounge" area with no permanent seating.[27]


The Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D high-bypass turbofan engine was developed for the 747.
One of the principal technologies that enabled an aircraft as large as the 747 to be conceived was the high-bypass turbofan engine.[28] The engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering double the power of the earlier turbojets while consuming a third less fuel. General Electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later.[29][30] Pratt &amp; Whitney was also working on the same principle and, by late 1966, Boeing, Pan Am and Pratt &amp; Whitney agreed to develop a new engine, designated the JT9D to power the 747.[30]

The project was designed with a new methodology called fault tree analysis, which allowed the effects of a failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems.[1] To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant hydraulic systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces.[31] Additionally, some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included slats running almost the entire length of the wing, as well as complex three-part slotted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing.[32] The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.[33]

Boeing agreed to deliver the first 747 to Pan Am by the end of 1969. The delivery date left 28 months to design the aircraft, which was two-thirds of the normal time.[34] The schedule was so fast paced that the people who worked on it were given the nickname "The Incredibles".[35] Developing the aircraft was such a technical and financial challenge that management was said to have "bet the company" when it started the project.[1]


747 final assembly at the Boeing Everett Factory
As Boeing did not have a plant large enough to assemble the giant airliner, they chose to build a new plant. The company considered locations in about 50 cities,[36] and eventually decided to build the new plant some 30 miles (50 km) north of Seattle on a site adjoining a military base at Paine Field near Everett, Washington.[37] It bought the 780-acre (3.2 km2) site in June 1966.[38]

Developing the 747 had been a major challenge, and building its assembly plant was also a huge undertaking. Boeing president William M. Allen asked Malcolm T. Stamper, then head of the company's turbine division, to oversee construction of the Everett factory and to start production of the 747.[39] To level the site, more than four million cubic yards (three million cubic meters) of earth had to be moved.[40] Time was so short that the 747's full-scale mock-up was built before the factory roof above it was finished.[41] The plant is the largest building by volume ever built, and has been substantially expanded several times to permit construction of other models of Boeing wide-body commercial jets.[37]


The prototype 747 was first displayed to the public on September 30, 1968
Before the first 747 was fully assembled, testing began on many components and systems. One important test involved the evacuation of 560 volunteers from a cabin mock-up via the aircraft's emergency chutes. The first full-scale evacuation took two and a half minutes instead of the maximum of 90 seconds mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and several volunteers were injured. Subsequent test evacuations achieved the 90-second goal but caused more injuries. Most problematic was evacuation from the aircraft's upper deck; instead of using a conventional slide, volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel.[42] Tests also involved taxiing such a large aircraft. Boeing built an unusual training device known as "Waddell's Wagon" (named for a 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) that consisted of a mock-up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck. While the first 747s were still being built, the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper-deck position.[43]

On September 30, 1968, the first 747 was rolled out of the Everett assembly building before the world's press and representatives of the 26 airlines that had ordered the airliner.[44] Over the following months, preparations were made for the first flight, which took place on February 9, 1969, with test pilots Jack Waddell and Brien Wygle at the controls[45][46] and Jess Wallick at the flight engineer's station. Despite a minor problem with one of the flaps, the flight confirmed that the 747 handled extremely well. The 747 was found to be largely immune to "Dutch roll", a phenomenon that had been a major hazard to the early swept-wing jets.[47]

During later stages of the flight test program, flutter testing showed that the wings suffered oscillation under certain conditions. This difficulty was partly solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components. However, a particularly severe high-speed flutter problem was solved only by inserting depleted uranium counterweights as ballast in the outboard engine nacelles of the early 747s.[48] This measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed, as did China Airlines Flight 358 at Wanli in 1991 and El Al Flight 1862 at Amsterdam in 1992 which had 282 kilograms (622 lb) of uranium in the tailplane.[49][50]

The flight test program was hampered by problems with the 747's JT9D engines. Difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the turbine casings after a short period of service.[51] The problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months, up to 20 aircraft at the Everett plant were stranded while awaiting engine installation.[52] The program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at Renton Municipal Airport, site of the company's Renton factory. On December 13, 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have test equipment removed and a cabin installed when pilot Ralph C. Cokely undershot the airport's short runway. The 747's right, outer landing gear was torn off and two engine nacelles were damaged.[53][54] However, these difficulties did not prevent Boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th Paris Air Show in mid-1969, where it was displayed to the public for the first time.[55] The 747 received its FAA airworthiness certificate in December 1969, clearing it for introduction into service.[56]

The huge cost of developing the 747 and building the Everett factory meant that Boeing had to borrow heavily from a banking syndicate. During the final months before delivery of the first aircraft, the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project. Had this been refused, Boeing's survival would have been threatened.[22][57] The firm's debt exceeded $2 billion, with the $1.2 billion owed to the banks setting a record for all companies. Allen later said, "It was really too large a project for us."[58] Ultimately, the gamble succeeded, and Boeing held a monopoly in very large passenger aircraft production for many years.[59]

On January 15, 1970, First Lady of the United States Pat Nixon christened Pan Am's first 747, at Dulles International Airport (later Washington Dulles International Airport) in the presence of Pan Am chairman Najeeb Halaby. Instead of champagne, red, white, and blue water was sprayed on the aircraft. The 747 entered service on January 22, 1970, on Pan Am's New York–London route;[60] the flight had been planned for the evening of January 21, but engine overheating made the original aircraft unusable. Finding a substitute delayed the flight by more than six hours to the following day.[2]


On the 747-100 and 747-200, a spiral staircase connected the main and upper decks. Previously, Boeing used a spiral staircase in its Model 377 Stratocruiser back in 1946.
The 747 enjoyed a fairly smooth introduction into service, overcoming concerns that some airports would not be able to accommodate an aircraft that large.[61] Although technical problems occurred, they were relatively minor and quickly solved.[62] After the aircraft's introduction with Pan Am, other airlines that had bought the 747 to stay competitive began to put their own 747s into service.[63] Boeing estimated that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines desiring the aircraft's long range rather than its payload capacity.[64][65] While the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat, this could only be achieved when the aircraft was fully loaded; costs per seat increased rapidly as occupancy declined. A moderately loaded 747, one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied, used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a fully occupied 747.[66]

The recession of 1969-1970 greatly affected Boeing. For the year and a half after September 1970 it only sold two 747s in the world, and did not sell any to an American carrier for almost three years.[58] When economic problems in the United States and other countries after the 1973 oil crisis led to reduced passenger traffic, several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 economically, and they replaced them with the smaller and recently introduced McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijet wide bodies[67] (and later the 767 and A300 twinjets). Having tried replacing coach seats on its 747s with piano bars in an attempt to attract more customers, American Airlines eventually relegated its 747s to cargo service and in 1983 exchanged them with Pan Am for smaller aircraft;[68] Delta Air Lines also removed its 747s from service after several years.[69] Delta later reacquired 747s after it merged with Northwest Airlines.[70]


Later 747 models featured a stretched upper deck.
International flights that bypassed traditional hub airports and landed at smaller cities became more common throughout the 1980s, and this eroded the 747's original market.[71] However, many international carriers continued to use the 747 on Pacific routes.[72] In Japan, 747s on domestic routes were configured to carry close to the maximum passenger capacity.[73]

After the initial 747-100 model, Boeing developed the −100B, a higher maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) variant, and the −100SR (Short Range), with higher passenger capacity.[74] Increased maximum takeoff weight allows aircraft to carry more fuel and have longer range.[75] The −200 model followed in 1971, featuring more powerful engines and a higher MTOW. Passenger, freighter and combination passenger-freighter versions of the −200 were produced.[74] The shortened 747SP (special performance) with a longer range was also developed, and entered service in 1976.[76]

The 747 line was further developed with the launch of the 747-300 in 1980. The 300 series resulted from Boeing studies to increase the seating capacity of the 747, during which modifications such as fuselage plugs and extending the upper deck over the entire length of the fuselage were rejected. The first 747-300, completed in 1983, included a stretched upper deck, increased cruise speed, and increased seating capacity. The -300 variant was previously designated 747SUD for stretched upper deck, then 747-200 SUD,[77] followed by 747EUD, before the 747-300 designation was used.[78] Passenger, short range and combination freighter-passenger versions of the 300 series were produced.[74]


The 747-400 entered service in 1989, with Air New Zealand among the first operators of the type.
In 1985, development of the longer range 747-400 began.[79] The variant had a new glass cockpit, which allowed for a cockpit crew of two instead of three,[80] new engines, lighter construction materials, and a redesigned interior. Development cost soared, and production delays occurred as new technologies were incorporated at the request of airlines. Insufficient workforce experience and reliance on overtime contributed to early production problems on the 747-400.[1] The −400 entered service in 1989.[81]

In 1991, a record-breaking 1,087 passengers were airlifted aboard a 747 to Israel as part of Operation Solomon.[82] The 747 remained the heaviest commercial aircraft in regular service until the debut of the Antonov An-124 Ruslan in 1982; variants of the 747-400 would surpass the An-124's weight in 2000. The Antonov An-225 Mriya cargo transport, which debuted in 1988, remains the world's largest aircraft by several measures (including the most accepted measures of maximum takeoff weight and length); one aircraft has been completed and is in service as of 2012. The Hughes H-4 Hercules is the largest aircraft by wingspan, but it only completed a single flight.[83]

Since the arrival of the 747-400, several stretching schemes for the 747 have been proposed. Boeing announced the larger 747-500X and -600X preliminary designs in 1996.[84] The new variants would have cost more than US$5 billion to develop,[84] and interest was not sufficient to launch the program.[85] In 2000, Boeing offered the more modest 747X and 747X stretch derivatives as alternatives to the Airbus A3XX. However, the 747X family was unable to attract enough interest to enter production. A year later, Boeing switched from the 747X studies to pursue the Sonic Cruiser,[86] and after the Sonic Cruiser program was put on hold, the 787 Dreamliner.[87] Some of the ideas developed for the 747X were used on the 747-400ER, a longer range variant of the 747-400.[88]

After several variants were proposed but later abandoned, some industry observers became skeptical of new aircraft proposals from Boeing.[89] However, in early 2004, Boeing announced tentative plans for the 747 Advanced that were eventually adopted. Similar in nature to the 747-X, the stretched 747 Advanced used technology from the 787 to modernize the design and its systems. The 747 remained the largest passenger airliner in service until the Airbus A380 began airline service in 2007.[90]

On November 14, 2005, Boeing announced it was launching the 747 Advanced as the Boeing 747-8.[91] The last 747-400s were completed in 2009.[92] As of 2011, most orders of the 747-8 have been for the freighter variant. On February 8, 2010, the 747-8 Freighter made its maiden flight.[93] The first scheduled delivery of the 747-8 went to Cargolux in 2011.[94][95] The 1,500th produced Boeing 747 was delivered in June 2014.[96] Eventually, the 747 may be replaced in Boeing's lineup by a new design codenamed "Y3".[97]

The Boeing 747 is a large, wide-body (two-aisle) airliner with four wing-mounted engines. The wings have a high sweep angle of 37.5 degrees for a fast, efficient cruise[26] of Mach 0.84 to 0.88, depending on the variant. The sweep also reduces the wingspan, allowing the 747 to use existing hangars.[1][98] Seating capacity is more than 366 with a 3–4–3 seat arrangement (a cross section of 3 seats, an aisle, 4 seats, another aisle, and 3 seats) in economy class and a 2–3–2 arrangement in first class on the main deck. The upper deck has a 3–3 seat arrangement in economy class and a 2–2 arrangement in first class.[99]

Raised above the main deck, the cockpit creates a hump. The raised cockpit allows front loading of cargo on freight variants.[26] The upper deck behind the cockpit provides space for a lounge or extra seating. The "stretched upper deck" became available as an option on the 747-100B variant and later as standard on the 747-300. The 747 cockpit roof section also has an escape hatch from which crew can exit in the event of an emergency if they cannot exit through the cabin.

The 747's maximum takeoff weight ranges from 735,000 pounds (333,400 kg) for the −100 to 970,000 lb (439,985 kg) for the −8. Its range has increased from 5,300 nautical miles (6,100 mi, 9,800 km) on the −100 to 8,000 nmi (9,200 mi, 14,815 km) on the −8I.[100][101]

The 747 has redundant structures along with four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with four wheels each, which provide a good spread of support on the ground and safety in case of tire blow-outs. The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly.[102] In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways.[103] For transportation of spare engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.[104][105]

The 747-100 was the original variant launched in 1966. The 747-200 soon followed, with its launch in 1968. The 747-300 was launched in 1980 and was followed by the 747-400 in 1985. Ultimately, the 747-8 was announced in 2005. Several versions of each variant have been produced, and many of the early variants were in production simultaneously. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) classifies variants using a shortened code formed by combining the model number and the variant designator (e.g. "B741" for all −100 models).[106]


Pan Am was the first airline to operate the 747. The 747-100 pictured shows the original size of the upper deck and window layout.
The first 747-100s were built with six upper deck windows (three per side) to accommodate upstairs lounge areas. Later, as airlines began to use the upper deck for premium passenger seating instead of lounge space, Boeing offered a ten-window upper deck as an option. Some early −100s were retrofitted with the new configuration.[107] The −100 was equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-3A engines. No freighter version of this model was developed, but many 747-100s were converted into freighters.[108] A total of 167 747-100s were built.[3] Iran Air was the last airline to use the 747-100 for passenger service.[109]

Responding to requests from Japanese airlines for a high-capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities, Boeing developed the 747SR as a short-range version of the 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability. With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models.[74] The 747SR had an economic design life objective of 52,000 flights during 20 years of operation, compared to 24,600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747.[110] The initial 747SR model, the −100SR, had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from a greater number of takeoffs and landings.[111] Extra structural support was built into the wings, fuselage, and the landing gear along with a 20 percent reduction in fuel capacity.[112]


One of two 747-100BSR SUD models built for Japan Airlines
The initial order for the −100SR — four aircraft for Japan Air Lines (JAL, later Japan Airlines) — was announced on October 30, 1972; rollout occurred on August 3, 1973, and the first flight took place on August 31, 1973. The type was certified by the FAA on September 26, 1973, with the first delivery on the same day. The -100SR entered service with JAL, the type's sole customer, on October 7, 1973, and typically operated flights within Japan.[38] Seven −100SRs were built between 1973 and 1975, each with a 520,000-pound (240,000 kg) MTOW and Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7A engines derated to 43,000 pounds-force (190,000 N) of thrust.[113]

Following the −100SR, Boeing produced the −100BSR, a 747SR variant with increased takeoff weight capability. Debuting in 1978, the −100BSR also incorporated structural modifications for a high cycle-to-flying hour ratio; a related standard −100B model debuted in 1979. The −100BSR first flew on November 3, 1978, with first delivery to All Nippon Airways (ANA) on December 21, 1978. A total of twenty −100BSRs were produced for ANA and JAL.[114] The −100BSR had a 600,000 lb MTOW and was powered by the same JT9D-7A or General Electric CF6-45 engines used on the −100SR. ANA operated the type on domestic Japanese routes with 455 or 456 seats until retiring its last aircraft on March 10, 2006.[115]

In 1986, two −100BSR SUD models, featuring the stretched upper deck (SUD) of the −300, were produced for JAL.[116] The type's maiden flight occurred on February 26, 1986, with FAA certification and first delivery on March 24, 1986.[117] JAL operated the −100BSR SUD with 563 seats on domestic routes until their retirement in the third quarter of 2006. While only two −100BSR SUDs were produced, in theory, standard −100Bs can be modified to the SUD certification.[114] Overall, twenty-nine 747SRs were built,[3] consisting of seven −100SRs, twenty −100BSRs, and two −100BSR SUDs.


The sole Iran Air 747-100B in passenger service in 2009
The 747-100B model was developed from the −100SR, using its stronger airframe and landing gear design. The type had an increased fuel capacity of 48,070 US gal (182,000 l; 40,030 imp gal), allowing for a 5,000-nautical-mile (9,300 km; 5,800 mi) range with a typical 452-passenger payload, and an increased MTOW of 750,000 lb (340,000 kg) was offered. The first −100B order, one aircraft for Iran Air, was announced on June 1, 1978. This aircraft first flew on June 20, 1979, received FAA certification on August 1, 1979, and was delivered the next day.[118] Nine −100Bs were built, one for Iran Air and eight for Saudi Arabian Airlines.[119][120] Unlike the original −100, the −100B was offered with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7A, General Electric CF6-50, or Rolls-Royce RB211-524 engines. However, only RB211-524 (Saudia) and JT9D-7A (Iran Air) engines were ordered.[121]

The development of the 747SP stemmed from a joint request between Pan American World Airways and Iran Air, who were looking for a high-capacity airliner with enough range to cover Pan Am's New York–Middle Eastern routes and Iran Air's planned Tehran–New York route. The Tehran–New York route, when launched, was the longest non-stop commercial flight in the world. The 747SP is 48 feet 4 inches (14.73 m) shorter than the 747-100. Fuselage sections were eliminated fore and aft of the wing, and the center section of the fuselage was redesigned to fit mating fuselage sections. The SP's flaps used a simplified single-slotted configuration.[122][123] The 747SP, compared to earlier variants, had a tapering of the aft upper fuselage into the empennage, a double-hinged rudder, and longer vertical and horizontal stabilizers.[124] Power was provided by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7(A/F/J/FW) or Rolls-Royce RB211-524 engines.[125]

The 747SP was granted a supplemental certificate on February 4, 1976 and entered service with launch customers Pan Am and Iran Air that same year.[123] The aircraft was chosen by airlines wishing to serve major airports with short runways.[126] A total of 45 747SPs were built,[3] with the 44th 747SP delivered on August 30, 1982. In 1987, Boeing re-opened the 747SP production line after five years to build one last 747SP for an order by the United Arab Emirates government.[123] In addition to airline use, one 747SP was modified for the NASA/German Aerospace Center SOFIA experiment.[127]


Alitalia 747-200B arriving at Rome Fiumicino Airport in 1990
While the 747-100 powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-3A engines offered enough payload and range for US domestic operations, it was marginal for long international route sectors. The demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly led to the improved −200, which featured more powerful engines, increased MTOW, and greater range than the −100. A few early −200s retained the three-window configuration of the −100 on the upper deck, but most were built with a ten-window configuration on each side.[128] The 747-200 was produced in passenger (−200B), freighter (−200F), convertible (−200C), and combi (−200M) versions.[129]

The 747-200B was the basic passenger version, with increased fuel capacity and more powerful engines; it entered service in February 1971.[77] In its first three years of production, the −200 was equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7 engines (initially the only engine available). Range with a full passenger load started at over 5,000 nmi (9,300 km) and increased to 6,000 nmi (11,000 km) with later engines. Most −200Bs had an internally stretched upper deck, allowing for up to 16 passenger seats.[130] The freighter model, the 747-200F, could be fitted with or without a side cargo door,[77] and had a capacity of 105 tons (95.3 tonnes) and an MTOW of up to 833,000 lb (378,000 kg). It entered service in 1972 with Lufthansa.[131] The convertible version, the 747-200C, could be converted between a passenger and a freighter or used in mixed configurations,[74] and featured removable seats and a nose cargo door.[77] The −200C could also be fitted with an optional side cargo door on the main deck.[132]

The combi model, the 747-200M, could carry freight in the rear section of the main deck via a side cargo door. A removable partition on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front. The −200M could carry up to 238 passengers in a three-class configuration with cargo carried on the main deck. The model was also known as the 747-200 Combi.[77] As on the −100, a stretched upper deck (SUD) modification was later offered. A total of 10 converted 747-200s were operated by KLM.[77] Union des Transports Aériens (UTA) also had two of these aircraft converted.[133][134]

After launching the −200 with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7 engines, on August 1, 1972 Boeing announced that it had reached an agreement with General Electric to certify the 747 with CF6-50 series engines to increase the aircraft's market potential. Rolls-Royce followed 747 engine production with a launch order from British Airways for four aircraft. The option of RB211-524B engines was announced on June 17, 1975.[121] The −200 was the first 747 to provide a choice of powerplant from the three major engine manufacturers.[135]

A total of 393 of the 747-200 versions had been built when production ended in 1991.[136] Of these, 225 were −200s, 73 were −200F, 13 were −200C, 78 were −200M, and 4 were military.[137] Many 747-200s remain in operation, although most large carriers have retired them from their fleets and sold them to smaller operators. Large carriers have sped up fleet retirement following the September 11 attacks and the subsequent drop in demand for air travel, scrapping some or turning others into freighters.[138][139]

The 747-300 features a 23-foot-4-inch-longer (7.11 m) upper deck than the −200.[78] The stretched upper deck has two emergency exit doors and is the most visible difference between the −300 and previous models. Before being made standard on the 747-300, the stretched upper deck was previously offered as a retrofit, and first appeared on two Japanese 747-100SR aircraft.[140] The 747−300 introduced a new straight stairway to the upper deck, instead of a spiral staircase on earlier variants, which creates room above and below for more seats.[74] Minor aerodynamic changes allowed the −300's cruise speed to reach Mach 0.85 compared with Mach 0.84 on the −200 and −100 models, while retaining the same takeoff weight.[78] The −300 could be equipped with the same Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce powerplants as on the −200, as well as updated General Electric CF6-80C2B1 engines.[74]

Swissair placed the first order for the 747-300 on June 11, 1980.[141] The variant revived the 747-300 designation, which had been previously used on a design study that did not reach production. The 747-300 first flew on October 5, 1982, and the type's first delivery went to Swissair on March 23, 1983.[38] Besides the passenger model, two other versions (−300M, −300SR) were produced. The 747-300M features cargo capacity on the rear portion of the main deck, similar to the −200M, but with the stretched upper deck it can carry more passengers.[125][142] The 747-300SR, a short range, high-capacity domestic model, was produced for Japanese markets with a maximum seating for 584.[143] No production freighter version of the 747-300 was built, but Boeing began modifications of used passenger −300 models into freighters in 2000.[144]

A total of 81 747-300 series aircraft were delivered, 56 for passenger use, 21 −300M and 4 −300SR versions.[145] In 1985, just two years after the −300 entered service, the type was superseded by the announcement of the more advanced 747-400.[146] The last 747-300 was delivered in September 1990 to Sabena.[74][147] While some −300 customers continued operating the type, several large carriers replaced their 747-300s with 747-400s. Air France, Air India, Pakistan International Airlines, and Qantas were some of the last major carriers to operate the 747-300. On December 29, 2008, Qantas flew its last scheduled 747-300 service, operating from Melbourne to Los Angeles via Auckland.[148]

The 747-400 is an improved model with increased range. It has wingtip extensions of 6 ft (1.8 m) and winglets of 6 ft (1.8 m), which improve the type's fuel efficiency by four percent compared to previous 747 versions.[149] The 747-400 introduced a new glass cockpit designed for a flight crew of two instead of three, with a reduction in the number of dials, gauges and knobs from 971 to 365 through the use of electronics. The type also features tail fuel tanks, revised engines, and a new interior. The longer range has been used by some airlines to bypass traditional fuel stops, such as Anchorage.[150] Powerplants include the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4062, General Electric CF6-80C2, and Rolls-Royce RB211-524.[151]

The −400 was offered in passenger (−400), freighter (−400F), combi (−400M), domestic (−400D), extended range passenger (−400ER), and extended range freighter (−400ERF) versions. Passenger versions retain the same upper deck as the −300, while the freighter version does not have an extended upper deck.[152] The 747-400D was built for short-range operations with maximum seating for 624. Winglets were not included, but they can be retrofitted.[153][154] Cruising speed is up to Mach 0.855 on different versions of the 747-400.[151]


British Airways is the world's largest 747-400 operator. Winglets distinguish most −400s from earlier variants.
The passenger version first entered service in February 1989 with launch customer Northwest Airlines on the Minneapolis to Phoenix route.[81] The combi version entered service in September 1989 with KLM, while the freighter version entered service in November 1993 with Cargolux. The 747-400ERF entered service with Air France in October 2002, while the 747-400ER entered service with Qantas,[155] its sole customer, in November 2002. In January 2004, Boeing and Cathay Pacific launched the Boeing 747-400 Special Freighter program,[156] later referred to as the Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF), to modify passenger 747-400s for cargo use. The first 747-400BCF was redelivered in December 2005.[157]

In March 2007, Boeing announced that it had no plans to produce further passenger versions of the −400.[158] However, orders for 36 −400F and −400ERF freighters were already in place at the time of the announcement.[158] The last passenger version of the 747-400 was delivered in April 2005 to China Airlines. Some of the last built 747-400s were delivered with Dreamliner livery along with the modern Signature interior from the Boeing 777. A total of 694 of the 747-400 series aircraft were delivered.[3] At various times, the largest 747-400 operator has included Singapore Airlines,[159] Japan Airlines,[159] and British Airways with 57 as of June 2013.[160][161]


The Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter, also named the Dreamlifter, is modified from ex-airline 747-400s
Main article: Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter
The 747-400 Dreamlifter[162] (originally called the 747 Large Cargo Freighter or LCF[163]) is a Boeing-designed modification of existing 747-400s to a larger configuration to ferry 787 Dreamliner sub-assemblies. Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation of Taiwan was contracted to complete modifications of 747-400s into Dreamlifters in Taoyuan. The aircraft flew for the first time on September 9, 2006 in a test flight.[164] Modification of four aircraft was completed by February 2010.[165] The Dreamlifters have been placed into service transporting sub-assemblies for the 787 program to the Boeing plant in Everett, Washington, for final assembly.[162] The aircraft is certified to carry only essential crew and not passengers.[166]

Main article: Boeing 747-8
Boeing announced a new 747 variant, the 747-8, on November 14, 2005. Referred to as the 747 Advanced prior to its launch, the 747-8 uses the same engine and cockpit technology as the 787, hence the use of the "8". The variant is designed to be quieter, more economical, and more environmentally friendly. The 747-8's fuselage is lengthened from 232 to 251 feet (70.8 to 76.4 m),[167] marking the first stretch variant of the aircraft. Power is supplied by General Electric GEnx-2B67 engines.[151]


The first Boeing 747-8 freighter on its maiden flight
The 747-8 Freighter, or 747-8F, is derived from the 747-400ERF. The variant has 16 percent more payload capacity than its predecessor, allowing it to carry seven additional standard air cargo containers, with a maximum payload capacity of 154 tons (140 tonnes) of cargo.[168] As on previous 747 freighters, the 747-8F features an overhead nose-door and a side-door on the main deck plus a side-door on the lower deck ("belly") to aid loading and unloading. The 747-8F made its maiden flight on February 8, 2010.[169][170] The variant received its amended type certificate jointly from the FAA and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on August 19, 2011.[171] The −8F was first delivered to Cargolux on October 12, 2011.[172]

The passenger version, named 747-8 Intercontinental or 747-8I, is designed to carry up to 467 passengers in a 3-class configuration and fly more than 8,000 nmi (15,000 km) at Mach 0.855. As a derivative of the already common 747-400, the 747-8 has the economic benefit of similar training and interchangeable parts.[173] The type's first test flight occurred on March 20, 2011.[174] At its introduction, the 747-8 surpassed the Airbus A340-600 as the world's longest airliner. The first −8I was delivered in May 2012 to Lufthansa.[175] The 747-8 has received 120 total orders, including 69 for the −8F and 51 for the −8I, as of May 2014.[3]


VC-25A 29000, one of two customized Boeing 747-200Bs in the U.S. presidential fleet since 1990
C-19 – The U.S. Air Force gave this designation to the 747-100s used by some U.S. airlines and modified for use in the Civil Reserve Airlift Fleet.[176]
VC-25 – This aircraft is the U.S. Air Force very important person (VIP) version of the 747-200B. The U.S. Air Force operates two of them in VIP configuration as the VC-25A. Tail numbers 28000 and 29000 are popularly known as Air Force One, which is technically the air-traffic call sign for any United States Air Force aircraft carrying the U.S. President. Although based on the 747-200B design, they include several innovations introduced on the 747-400. Partially completed aircraft from Everett, Washington, were flown to Wichita, Kansas, for final outfitting.
E-4B – Formerly known as the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (referred to colloquially as "Kneecap"), this aircraft is now referred to as the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC).

Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, a modified 747 designed to transport the Space Shuttle
YAL-1 – This is the experimental Airborne Laser, a component of the National Missile Defense plan.
Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) – Two 747s were modified to carry the Space Shuttle orbiter. The first was a 747-100 (N905NA), and the other was a 747-100SR (N911NA). The first SCA carried the prototype Enterprise during the Approach and Landing Tests in the late 1970s. The two SCA later carried all five operational Space Shuttle orbiters.
C-33 – This aircraft was a proposed U.S. military version of the 747-400 intended to augment the C-17 fleet. The plan was canceled in favor of additional C-17s.

20-1101 Japanese Air Force One, one of two customized Boeing 747-400s in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force since 1993
KC-33A – A proposed 747 was also adapted as an aerial refueling tanker and was bid against the DC-10-30 during the 1970s Advanced Cargo Transport Aircraft (ACTA) program that produced the KC-10A Extender. Before the Khomeini-led revolution, Iran bought four 747-100 aircraft with air-refueling boom conversions to support its fleet of F-4 Phantoms.[177][178] It is unknown whether these aircraft remain usable as tankers. Since then, other proposals have emerged for adaptation of later 747-400 aircraft for this role.[177]
747 CMCA – This "Cruise Missile Carrier Aircraft" variant was considered by the U.S. Air Force during the development of the B-1 Lancer strategic bomber. It would have been equipped with 50 to 100 AGM-86 ALCM cruise missiles on rotary launchers. This plan was abandoned in favor of more conventional strategic bombers.[179]

747 "airborne aircraft carrier" concept
747 AAC – a Boeing study under contract from the USAF for an "airborne aircraft carrier" for up to 10 "microfighters". Able to launch, retrieve and re-arm and refuel, Boeing believed that the scheme might be cheaper than establishing a short-term land base. A 747-200 and a Lockheed C-5A were considered as the base aircraft. The concept, which included a complementary 747 AWACS version with two reconnaissance "microfighters", was not considered to have sufficient merit for further consideration.[180][unreliable source?]

A number of other governments also use the 747 as a VIP transport, including Bahrain, Brunei, India, Iran, Japan, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Several Boeing 747-8s have been ordered by Boeing Business Jet for conversion to VIP transports for several unidentified customers.[182]
Boeing has studied a number of 747 variants that have not gone beyond the concept stage.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the development of a shorter 747 with three engines, to compete with the smaller L-1011 TriStar and DC-10. The 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, and passenger capacity than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S-duct intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.[183]

Boeing announced the 747 ASB (Advanced Short Body) in 1986 as a response to the Airbus A340 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-11. This aircraft design would have combined the advanced technology used on the 747-400 with the foreshortened 747SP fuselage. The aircraft was to carry 295 passengers a range of 8,000 nmi (9,200 mi; 15,000 km).[184] However, airlines were not interested in the project and it was cancelled in 1988 in favor of the 777.


The proposed 747-500X and −600X as depicted in an 1998 FAA illustration
Boeing announced the 747-500X and −600X at the 1996 Farnborough Airshow.[84] The proposed models would have combined the 747's fuselage with a new 251 ft (77 m) span wing derived from the 777. Other changes included adding more powerful engines and increasing the number of tires from two to four on the nose landing gear and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear.[185]

The 747-500X concept featured an increased fuselage length of 18 ft (5.5 m) to 250 ft (76.2 m) long, and the aircraft was to carry 462 passengers over a range up to 8,700 nautical miles (10,000 mi, 16,100 km), with a gross weight of over 1.0 Mlb (450 tonnes).[185] The 747-600X concept featured a greater stretch to 279 ft (85 m) with seating for 548 passengers, a range of up to 7,700 nmi (8,900 mi, 14,300 km), and a gross weight of 1.2 Mlb (540 tonnes).[185] A third study concept, the 747-700X, would have combined the wing of the 747-600X with a widened fuselage, allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747-400.[84] The cost of the changes from previous 747 models, in particular the new wing for the 747-500X and −600X, was estimated to be more than US$5 billion.[84] Boeing was not able to attract enough interest to launch the aircraft.[85]

As Airbus progressed with its A3XX study, Boeing offered a 747 derivative as an alternative in 2000; a more modest proposal than the previous −500X and −600X that retained the 747's overall wing design and add a segment at the root, increasing the span to 229 ft (69.8 m).[186] Power would have been supplied by either the Engine Alliance GP7172 or the Rolls-Royce Trent 600, which were also proposed for the 767-400ERX.[187] A new flight deck based on the 777's would be used. The 747X aircraft was to carry 430 passengers over ranges of up to 8,700 nmi (10,000 mi, 16,100 km). The 747X Stretch would be extended to 263 ft (80.2 m) long, allowing it to carry 500 passengers over ranges of up to 7,800 nmi (9,000 mi, 14,500 km).[186] Both would feature an interior based on the 777.[188] Freighter versions of the 747X and 747X Stretch were also studied.[189]


The 747-400ER was derived from the 747-400X study.
Like its predecessor, the 747X family was unable to garner enough interest to justify production, and it was shelved along with the 767-400ERX in March 2001, when Boeing announced the Sonic Cruiser concept.[86] Though the 747X design was less costly than the 747-500X and −600X, it was criticized for not offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747-400. The 747X did not make it beyond the drawing board, but the 747-400X being developed concurrently moved into production to become the 747-400ER.[190]

After the end of the 747X program, Boeing continued to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980 nmi (9,200 mi, 14,800 km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise.[191][192] Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction.[193] Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.

Main article: Boeing 747 hull losses
As of September 2015, the 747 has been involved in 131 accidents or incidents,[196] including 60 hull-loss accidents,[197] resulting in 3,718 fatalities. The 747 has been in 31 hijackings, which caused 24 fatalities.[198]

Few crashes have been attributed to design flaws of the 747. The Tenerife airport disaster resulted from pilot error and communications failure, while the Japan Airlines Flight 123 and China Airlines Flight 611 crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair. United Airlines Flight 811, which suffered an explosive decompression mid-flight on February 24, 1989, led the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to issue a recommendation that 747-200 cargo doors similar to those on the Flight 811 aircraft be modified. Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had strayed into Soviet territory, causing U.S. President Ronald Reagan to authorize the then-strictly military global positioning system (GPS) for civilian use.[199]

Accidents due to design errors included TWA Flight 800, where a 747-100 exploded in mid-air on July 17, 1996, probably due to sparking electricity wires inside the fuel tank;[200] this finding led the FAA to propose a rule requiring installation of an inerting system in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in July 2008, after years of research into solutions. At the time, the new safety system was expected to cost US$100,000 to $450,000 per aircraft and weigh approximately 200 pounds (91 kg).[201] El Al Flight 1862 crashed after the fuse pins of engine number 3 broke off shortly after take-off due to metal fatigue. Instead of dropping away from the wing, engine #3 knocked off engine #4 as well as damaging the wing.[202]

As increasing numbers of "classic" 747-100 and 747-200 series aircraft have been retired, some have found their way into museums or other uses. The City of Everett, the first 747 and prototype, is at the Museum of Flight, Seattle, Washington, USA where it is sometimes leased to Boeing for test purposes.[203]

Other 747s in museums include those at the National Aviation Theme Park Aviodrome, Lelystad, The Netherlands; the Qantas Founders Outback Museum, Longreach, Queensland, Australia; Rand Airport, Johannesburg, South Africa; Technikmuseum Speyer, Speyer, Germany; Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace, Paris, France; Tehran Aerospace Exhibition, Tehran, Iran; Jeongseok Aviation Center, Jeju, South Korea,[204] Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum, McMinnville, Oregon, and the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C.[205]

Upon its retirement from service, the 747 number two in the production line was dismantled and shipped to Hopyeong, Namyangju, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea where it was re-assembled, repainted in a livery similar to that of Air Force One and converted into a restaurant. Originally flown commercially by Pan Am as N747PA, Clipper Juan T. Trippe, and repaired for service following a tailstrike, it stayed with the airline until its bankruptcy. The restaurant closed by 2009,[206] and the aircraft was scrapped in 2010.[207]

A former British Airways 747-200B, G-BDXJ,[208] is parked at the Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, England and has been used as a movie set for productions such as the 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale.[209] The plane also appears frequently in the BBC television series Top Gear, which is filmed at Dunsfold.

The Jumbohostel, using a converted 747-200, opened at Arlanda Airport, Stockholm on January 15, 2009.[210][211]

The wings of a 747 have been recycled as roofs of a house in Malibu, California.[212][213][214][215]

The 747 parasitic drag, CDP, is 0.022, and the wing area is 5,500 square feet (511 m2), so that f equals about 121 sq ft (11.2 m2). The parasitic drag is given by ½ f ρair v² in which f is the product of drag coefficient CDp and the wing area.[224]
Main article: Aircraft in fiction (Boeing 747)
Following its debut, the 747 rapidly achieved iconic status, appearing in numerous film productions such as the Airport series of disaster films, Air Force One, and Executive Decision.[225][226] Appearing in over 300 film productions [227] the 747 is one of the most widely depicted civilian aircraft and is considered by many as one of the most iconic in film history.[228] The aircraft entered the cultural lexicon as the original Jumbo Jet, a term coined by the aviation media to describe its size,[229] and was also nicknamed Queen of the Skies.[230]

            <Title>6: Awake</Title>
            <Text>“Lily.”
Oh, hey, that’s me.
“Lily.”
Why was someone saying my name?  And saying it wrong.
“Talk to me, girl.”  Except it was gihl.  Terry?
I struggled to open my eyes.  A brown haze of a perm surrounded an indistinct face that was tanned to only a few shades lighter.  Terry.
The synchronized drumbeats in my head and chest began to slow and my senses came back one at a time.
Hearing: Where was the wind?  It’s so quiet now.
Smell: Cheap rum.
Sight: Terry’s face couldn’t have been more than a few inches from mine, eyes darting left and right between my own.
Touch: He had a grip on my arms that would likely leave bruises.  I think I remember him shaking me.
Taste: … something.  There was a memory of the stale taste of the oxygen, but it was fading fast.
“Terry!”  My hands gripped his arms in return.  “The plane!”
But as more around me came into focus, I realized where I was: sitting in the jump seat by the Coach lavatories.  I was no more than three feet from where a gaping, cloud-filled hole had been only moments before.
“There’s a girl!”  He rocked back and stood up before me, pulling out of my grip.  “You alright?  You gave me quite a scare.”
Nothing made sense!  Where’s the hole?  Why weren’t we falling out of the sky, centripetal force pushing us against the walls?
Dios mio, that’s what that had been: we were in enough of a flat spin to push us against the walls.
 I started to dry heave but nothing came up.  Terry was a blur of motion and there was an airsick bag in front of my mouth.
But … not … now.  This is normal.  Gravity works again.
“Take it easy.  Just breathe for me.”
“Terry—”  My throat was dry, my voice a crackling whisper.  I licked my lips, closed my eyes, and started over.  “Terry, what about the crash?”
His eyes shot wide at the last word and his head spun around, searching to see if another passenger had heard me.  He tilted his head and shot me a look that made two things perfectly clear:
One, I may have been a rookie, but I should still know which words to avoid in flight.
Two, he had no idea what I was talking about.
“But … I …”  I licked my lips and settled on “what happened?”
He squatted in front of me again, lowering the airsick back and folding it flat with a flick that all of us could do without thinking.
“You fainted.”
“I did?”
“You were fine one second and half-way to the floor the next.”  His voice, already in that sotto voce we used out of habit when talking with other crew, dropped to barely audible above the white noise of the jet engines.  “When did you last eat?”
A question fair enough that I answered it without thinking.
“Sandwich.  When I got the call.”
Stewardesses, flight attendants, whatever, were not exactly known for our stellar eating habits.  We weren’t home often enough or long enough to keep well-stocked pantries and we didn’t make enough money to dine out everywhere we went.  Many of us subsisted on in-flight food, and I knew some who flew literally so they could feed themselves.  It didn’t help that we were expected to stay model-thin.  Oh sure, the airlines weren’t allowed to fire us for hitting a size six, but we all knew exactly what would happen.
Terry looked at me, dubious.
“Sit here.”  The stone in his gaze was shattered by my amusement that the last word came out “hee-ya”.  “Don’t move.”
He walked off at Don’t Interrupt Me I’m On Business speed up the aisle.
I took a moment to look around.
Everything was back.  Everything.
There was no hole, no screaming passengers, no cloudy sky.  It was normal.
The cabin lights were up, rigged for evening illumination instead of night.
The beverage cart stood, wheels locked in place between me and the galley.  It was fully stocked, loaded with plastic cups, aluminum cans, and small glass bottles of cheap alcohol.
And that rum smell?  There was a broken bottle between me and the cart.  The neck had sheared off and half of the liquid had spilled onto the carpet.
Seeing the mess, something clicked inside.  I stood up, walked to the galley for a towel, and stooped to mop up the mess.  It took a moment to realize that my head was clear—the drumbeat was gone and I wasn’t at all dizzy or nauseous.  Other than being a bit confused, I was perfectly fine.
Terry returned, small plastic container in his hand.  I recognized it as a single-serving salad from one of the First Class meal packs.  He waved me around behind the cart and into the galley, flourishing a metal fork from nowhere.
“Take a moment.  We’ve got time.”
He put himself between me and anyone in the last few rows who might turn around, keeping me in his peripheral vision.
I was going to protest, but it occurred to me that he was right—I was hungrier than I had realized.  I had the lid off and half of the salad put away before I realized what I was doing.
Had I just fainted and hit my head?
No.  Not possible.  It’s been hours since we were here.
“What, uh,” I whispered.  Terry smiled at a passenger I couldn’t see and inclined his head toward me to show he was listening.  “What time do you have?”
“Coming up on nine-thirty, Pacific.”  Terry’s watch was a huge gold-plated monstrosity that I could almost read from six feet away.  It had an almost vertical bar of hands on the 12 and 6—he kept his watch on Eastern time and translated without thinking about it.
I wolfed down the other two bites of my salad.
“We need to go,” I threw the cart a vague wave with my fork, “if we’re going to beat the weather.”  I cut off his squint with “And I’m feeling better already.  Thank you very much.”
He nodded and unlocked the wheels of the cart, pulling it forward as he backed up the aisle, throwing cautious glances over his shoulder.  I gave my mouth a quick dab with a paper napkin and caught up to him a few rows later, pushing the cart to allow him to face forward.
We reached the front of Coach, him at row 7 and me next to 9.  I had the strangest feeling of deja vu that I couldn’t nail down.  It felt like I had done this all before, and I remembered doing it before, but …
But I’ve done this hundreds of times in the last six months.
And of course I recognize these people—I helped them board, got them pillows, looked them each in the eyes as I performed the safety demonstration.
You’re just … I don’t know.  Maybe you’re juggling too much.
I’d lost a few seconds in thought and the man in 9A harrumphed at me.  I gave him my warmest, non-culpable smile.
“What can I get for you this evening, sir?”
“What booze ya got?”</Text>

The Boeing 707 is a mid-size, long-range, narrow-body four-engine jet airliner built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes from 1958 to 1979. Its name is commonly pronounced as "Seven Oh Seven". Versions of the aircraft have a capacity from 140 to 219 passengers and a range of 2,500 to 5,750 nautical miles (4,630 to 10,650 km).[4]

Developed as Boeing's first jet airliner, the 707 is a swept-wing design with podded engines. Although it was not the first jetliner in service, the 707 was the first to be commercially successful. Dominating passenger air transport in the 1960s and remaining common through the 1970s, the 707 is generally credited with ushering in the Jet Age.[5][6] It established Boeing as one of the largest manufacturers of passenger aircraft, and led to the later series of airliners with "7x7" designations. The later 727, 737, and 757 share elements of the 707's fuselage design.

The 707 was developed from the Boeing 367-80, a prototype jet first flown in 1954. A larger fuselage cross-section and other modifications resulted in the initial production 707-120, powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojet engines, which first flew on December 20, 1957. Pan American World Airways began regular 707 service on October 26, 1958. Later derivatives included the shortened long-range 707-138 and the stretched 707-320, both of which entered service in 1959. A smaller short-range variant, the 720, was introduced in 1960. The 707-420, a version of the stretched 707 with Rolls-Royce Conway turbofans, debuted in 1960, while Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D turbofans debuted on the 707-120B and 707-320B models in 1961 and 1962, respectively.

The 707 has been used on domestic, transcontinental and transatlantic flights, and for cargo and military applications. A convertible passenger-freighter model, the 707-320C, entered service in 1963, and passenger 707s have been modified to freighter configurations. Military derivatives include the E-3 Sentry airborne reconnaissance aircraft and the C-137 Stratoliner VIP transports. Boeing produced and delivered 1,011 airliners including the smaller 720 series; over 800 military versions were also produced. There were 10 Boeing 707s in commercial service in July 2013.

Main article: Boeing 367-80
During and after World War II, Boeing was known for its military aircraft. The company had produced innovative and important bombers, from the B-17 Flying Fortress and B-29 Superfortress, to the jet-powered B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress. The company's civil aviation department lagged far behind Douglas and other competitors, the only noteworthy airliners being the Boeing 314 Clipper and 307 Stratoliner. During 1949–1950, Boeing embarked on studies for a new jet transport, realizing that any design must be aimed at both the military and civil markets. At the time, aerial refueling was becoming a standard technique for military aircraft, with over 800 KC-97 Stratofreighters on order. With the advent of the jet age, a new tanker was required to meet the USAF's fleet of jet-powered bombers; this was where Boeing's new design would potentially win military orders.[7]

Boeing studied numerous wing and engine layouts for its new transport/tanker, some of which were based on the B-47 and C-97, before settling on 367–80. The "Dash 80" took less than two years from project launch in 1952 to rollout on May 14, 1954, then first flew on July 15, 1954. It was powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojet engine, which was the civilian version of the J57 used on many military aircraft of the day, including the F-100 Super Sabre fighter and the B-52 bomber. The prototype was a proof of concept aircraft for both military and civilian use. The United States Air Force was the first customer, using it as the basis for the KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refueling platform.

It was far from certain that the passenger 707 would be profitable. At the time, Boeing was making nearly all of its money from military contracts: Its last passenger transport, the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, had netted the company a $15 million loss before it was purchased by the Air Force as the KC-97 Stratofreighter.[8] In a demonstration flight over Lake Washington outside Seattle, on August 7, 1955, test pilot Tex Johnston performed a barrel roll in the 367-80 prototype.[9]

The 132-inch (3,350 mm) wide fuselage of the Dash 80 was large enough for four-abreast (two-plus-two) seating (in the manner of the Stratocruiser). Answering customers' demands and under Douglas competition, Boeing soon realized that this would not provide a viable payload, so it widened the fuselage to 144 in (3,660 mm) to allow five-abreast seating and use of the KC-135's tooling.[10] Douglas Aircraft had launched its DC-8 with a fuselage width of 147 in (3,730 mm). The airlines liked the extra space and six-abreast seating, and so Boeing increased the 707's width again to compete, this time to 148 in (3,760 mm).[11]

The first flight of the first production 707-120 took place on December 20, 1957, and FAA certification followed on September 18, 1958.[12] Both test pilots Joseph John "Tym" Tymczyszyn and James R. Gannett were awarded the first Iven C. Kincheloe Award for the test flights that led to certification.[13] A number of changes were incorporated into the production models from the prototype. A Krueger flap was installed along the leading edge between the inner and outer engines on early 707-120 and −320 models.[3][14]


Early production Boeing 707–329 of Sabena in April 1960 with the original short tail-fin and no ventral fin
The initial standard model was the 707-120 with JT3C turbojet engines. Qantas ordered a shorter body version called the 707-138, which was a −120 that had six fuselage frames removed, three in front of the wings, and three aft. The frames in the 707 were each 20 inches (500 mm) apart, so this resulted in a net shortening of 10 ft (3 m) to 134 ft 6 in (41.0 m). Because the maximum takeoff weight remained the same 247,000 lb (112 t) as that of the −120, the 138 was able to fly the longer routes that Qantas needed.[14] Braniff International Airways ordered the higher-thrust version with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A engines, the 707-220. The final major derivative was the 707-320, which featured an extended-span wing and JT4A engines, while the 707-420 was the same as the −320 but with Conway turbofan engines. British certification requirements relating to engine-out go-arounds also forced Boeing to increase the height of the tail fin on all 707 variants, as well as add a ventral fin, which was retrofitted on earlier −120 and −220 aircraft. These modifications also aided in the mitigation of dutch roll by providing more stability in yaw.

Though initially fitted with turbojet engines, the dominant engine for the Boeing 707 family was the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D, a turbofan variant of the JT3C with lower fuel consumption and higher thrust. JT3D-engined 707s and 720s were denoted with a "B" suffix. While many 707-120Bs and 720Bs were conversions of existing JT3C-powered machines, 707-320Bs were available only as newly built aircraft, as they had a stronger structure to support a maximum take-off weight increased by 19,000 lb (8,600 kg), along with modifications to the wing. The 707-320B series enabled non-stop westbound flights from Europe to the US west coast and from the US to Japan.

The final 707 variant was the 707-320C, (C for "Convertible"), which had a large fuselage door for cargo. It had a revised wing with three-section leading-edge flaps, improving takeoff and landing performance and allowed the ventral fin to be removed (although the taller fin was retained). 707-320Bs built after 1963 used the same wing as the −320C and were known as 707-320B Advanced aircraft.

Production of the passenger 707 ended in 1978. In total, 1,010 707s were built for civil use, though many of these found their way to military service. The 707 production line remained open for purpose-built military variants until 1991, with the last new build 707 airframes built as E-3 and E-6 aircraft.

Traces of the 707 are still found in the 737, which uses a modified version of the 707's fuselage, as well as the same external nose and cockpit configuration as the those of 707. These were also used on the previous 727, while the 757 also used the 707 fuselage cross-section.

The 707 wings are swept back at 35 degrees and, like all swept-wing aircraft, displayed an undesirable "Dutch roll" flying characteristic that manifested itself as an alternating yawing and rolling motion. Boeing already had considerable experience with this on the B-47 and B-52, and had developed the yaw damper system on the B-47 that would be applied to later swept wing configurations like the 707. However, many new 707 pilots had no experience with this phenomenon, as they were transitioning from straight-wing propeller-driven aircraft such as the Douglas DC-7 and Lockheed Constellation.

On one customer acceptance flight, where the yaw damper was turned off to familiarize the new pilots with flying techniques, a trainee pilot's actions violently exacerbated the Dutch roll motion and caused three of the four engines to be torn from the wings. The plane, a brand new 707-227, N7071, destined for Braniff, crash-landed on a river bed north of Seattle at Arlington, Washington, killing four of the eight occupants.[15]

In his autobiography, test pilot Tex Johnston described a Dutch roll incident he experienced as a passenger on an early commercial 707 flight. As the aircraft's movements did not cease and most of the passengers became ill, he suspected a misrigging of the directional autopilot (yaw damper). He went to the cockpit and found the crew unable to understand and resolve the situation. He introduced himself and relieved the ashen-faced captain who immediately left the cockpit feeling ill. Johnston disconnected the faulty autopilot and manually stabilized the plane "with two slight control movements".[16]

The 707s used engine-driven turbocompressors to supply pressurized air for cabin pressurization. On many commercial 707s, the outer port (#1) engine mount is distinctly different from the other three, as this is the only engine not fitted with a turbocompressor. The turbocompressors fitted on engines 2 through 4 provide the required triple redundancy for the aircraft's cabin pressurization and air-conditioning system.

The P&amp;W JT3D-3B engines are readily identifiable by the large gray secondary air inlet doors in the nose cowl. These doors are fully open (sucked in at the rear) during takeoff to provide additional air. When the engines are throttled back to cruise, the doors are shut.

The 707 was the first commercial jet aircraft to be fitted with clamshell type thrust reversers on each of the four engines.[17]


Omega Air's 707-330C testbed for the 707RE program takes off from the Mojave Airport
Pratt &amp; Whitney, in a joint venture with Seven Q Seven (SQS) and Omega Air, has selected the JT8D-219 as a re-engine powerplant for Boeing 707-based aircraft, calling their modified configuration a 707RE.[18] Northrop Grumman has selected the −219 to re-engine the United States Air Force's fleet of 19 E-8 Joint STARS aircraft, which will allow the J-STARS more time on station due to the engine's greater fuel efficiency. NATO also plans to re-engine their fleet of E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft. The −219 is publicized as being half the cost of the competing 707 re-engine powerplant, the CFM International CFM56, and is 40 dB quieter than JT3D engines that are being replaced.[18]

The first commercial orders for the 707 came on October 13, 1955,[19] when Pan Am committed to 20 707s and 25 Douglas DC-8s, a dramatic increase in passenger capacity over its existing fleet of propeller aircraft. The competition between the 707 and Douglas DC-8 was fierce. Several major airlines committed only to the DC-8, as Douglas Aircraft was a more established maker of passenger aircraft at the time. To stay competitive, Boeing made a late and costly decision to redesign and enlarge the 707's wing to help increase range and payload. The new version was numbered 707-320.

Pan Am was the first airline to operate the 707; the carrier inaugurated 707 service with a christening at National Airport on October 17, 1958, attended by President Eisenhower, followed by a transatlantic flight for VIPs (personal guests of founder Juan Trippe) from Baltimore's Friendship International Airport to Paris.[20] The aircraft's first commercial flight was from Idlewild Airport, New York to Le Bourget, Paris on October 26, 1958 with a fuel stop in Gander, Newfoundland. In December, National Airlines operated the first U.S. domestic jet airline flights between New York/Idlewild and Miami, using 707s leased from Pan Am; American Airlines was the first domestic airline to fly its own jets, on January 25, 1959. TWA started domestic 707-131 flights in March and Continental Airlines started 707-124 flights in June; airlines that had ordered only the DC-8, such as United, Delta, and Eastern, were left without jets until September and lost market share on transcontinental flights. Qantas was the first non-US airline to use the 707s, starting in 1959.

The 707 quickly became the most popular jetliner of its time. Its popularity led to rapid developments in airport terminals, runways, airline catering, baggage handling, reservations systems, and other air transport infrastructure. The advent of the 707 also led to the upgrading of air traffic control systems to prevent interference with military jet operations.[21]

As the 1960s drew to a close, the exponential growth in air travel led to the 707's being a victim of its own success. The 707 was now too small to handle the increased passenger densities on the routes for which it was designed. Stretching the fuselage was not a viable option because the installation of larger, more powerful engines would in turn need a larger undercarriage, which was not feasible given the design's limited ground clearance. Boeing's answer to the problem was the first twin-aisle airliner—the Boeing 747. The 707's first-generation engine technology was also rapidly becoming obsolete in the areas of noise and fuel economy, especially after the 1973 oil crisis.


Saha Airlines Boeing 707 landing at Tehran-Mehrabad in 2011. Saha Airlines was the last commercial operator of the 707.
In 1982, during the Falklands War the Argentine Air Force extensively used 707s for long-range maritime patrol, with some of them being intercepted and shepherded away by Royal Navy Sea Harriers,[22] it also led to the conversion of British Nimrods to carry Sidewinder air-to-air missiles after a casual encounter.

Trans World Airlines flew the last scheduled 707 flight for passengers by a US carrier on October 30, 1983,[23] although 707s remained in scheduled service by airlines from other nations for much longer. Middle East Airlines (MEA) of Lebanon flew 707s and 720s in front-line passenger service until the end of the 1990s. Since LADE of Argentina took its 707-320B from regular service in 2007, Saha Airlines of Iran was the last airline to keep 707s in scheduled passenger service until April 2013.[24]

Operations of the 707 were threatened by the enactment of international noise regulations in 1985. Shannon Engineering of Seattle, Washington developed a hush kit with funding from Tracor, Inc, of Austin, Texas. By the late 1980s, 172 Boeing 707s had been equipped with the Quiet 707 package. Boeing acknowledged that more 707s were in service then than before the hush kit was available.[25] Most remaining 707s are in freighter form, or as Business Jets.[26]

Although certificated as Series 100s, 200s, 300s, etc., the different 707 variants are more commonly known as Series 120s, 220s, 320s, and so on, where the "20" part of the designation is Boeing's "customer number" for its development aircraft.

Main article: Boeing 720
The 707-020 was the original designation for what ultimately became the Boeing 720. Launch customer United Air Lines was a Douglas DC-8 customer and preferred not to be seen as buying the competing 707 hence the 720 designation. American Airlines always referred to its 720s as 707s.


Turkish Airlines 707-121B in 1976
The 707-120 was the first production 707 variant, with a longer, wider fuselage, and greater wingspan than the Dash-80. The cabin had a full set of rectangular windows and could seat up to 189 passengers.[27] It was designed for transcontinental routes and often required a refueling stop when flying across the North Atlantic. It had four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C-6 turbojets, civil versions of the military J57, initially producing 13,000 lb (57.8 kN) with water injection. Maximum takeoff weight was 247,000 lb and first flight was on December 20, 1957. Major orders were the launch order for 20 707-121 aircraft by Pan American and an American Airlines order for 30 707-123 aircraft. The first revenue flight was on October 26, 1958.[28] 56 were built, plus 7 short body −138s; the last −120 was delivered to Western in May 1960.

The 707-138 was a −120 with a fuselage ten feet shorter than the others, with 5 feet (3 frames) removed ahead and behind the wing, giving increased range. Maximum take off weight was the same 247,000 lb as the standard version. It was a variant for Qantas, thus had its customer number 38. The seven −138s were delivered to Qantas June–September 1959 and first carried passengers that July.

The 707-120B had Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D-1 turbofan engines, which were quieter, more powerful, and more fuel-efficient, producing 17,000 lbf (75.6 kN) each, with the later JT3D-3 version giving 18,000 lbf (80 kN). (This thrust did not require water injection, eliminating both the system and the 5000–6000 lb weight of the water itself.) The −120B had the wing modifications introduced on the 720 and a longer tailplane; a total of 72 were built, 31 for American and 41 for TWA, plus 6 short body −138Bs for Qantas. American had its 23 surviving −123s converted to 123Bs but TWA did not convert its 15 -131s. The only other conversions were Pan American's 5 surviving −121s and one surviving −139, the 3 aircraft delivered to the USAF as −153s and the 7 short body Qantas −138s. The first flight of the −120B was on June 22, 1960 and American carried the first passengers in March 1961; the last delivery was to American in April 1969. Maximum weight was 258,000 lb (117,025 kg) for both the long and short body versions.

The 707-220 was designed for hot and high operations with more powerful 15,800 lb (70.3 kN) Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A-3 turbojets. Five of these were produced, but only four were ultimately delivered with one being lost during a test flight. All were for Braniff International Airways and carried the model number 707-227; the first entered service in December 1959. This version was made obsolete by the arrival of the turbofan-powered 707-120B.

The 707-320 Intercontinental is a stretched version of the turbojet-powered 707-120, initially powered by JT4A-3 or JT4A-5 turbojets producing 15,800 lb (70.3 kN) each (most eventually got 17,500 lb (78.4 kN) JT4A-11s). The interior allowed up to 189 passengers, the same as the -120 and -220 series, but improved 2-class capacitity due to an 80-inch (2,000 mm) fuselage stretch ahead of the wing (from 138 ft 10 in (42.32 m) to 145 ft 6 in (44.35 m) ), with extensions to the fin and horizontal stabilizer extending the aircraft's length further.[29] The longer wing carried more fuel, increasing range by 1,600 miles (2,600 km) and allowing the aircraft to operate as true transoceanic aircraft. The wing modifications included outboard and inboard inserts, as well as a kink in the trailing edge to add area inboard.[14] Takeoff weight was increased to 302,000 lb (137,000 kg) initially and to 312,000 lb (142,000 kg) with the higher-rated JT4As and centre section tanks. First flight was on January 11, 1958; 69 turbojet 707-320s were delivered through January 1963, the first passengers being carried (by Pan Am) in August 1959. No −320 Intercontinental models were re-engined with fan engines in civil use, but around year 2000 the Israeli Air Force re-engined two ex-Sabena −320 based military tankers.


Conway-powered BOAC 707-436 at Sydney Airport in 1970.
The 707-420 was identical to the −320 but fitted with Rolls-Royce Conway 508 (RCo.12) turbofans (or by-pass turbojets as Rolls-Royce called them) of 18,000 lb (79 kN) thrust each.[30] First announced customer was Lufthansa. BOAC's controversial order was announced six months later but the British carrier got the first service-ready aircraft off the production line. The British Air Registration Board refused to give the aircraft a certificate of airworthiness, citing insufficient lateral control, excessive rudder forces and the ability to over rotate on take off, stalling the wing on the ground (a fault of the de Havilland Comet 1). Boeing responded by adding 40 inches to the vertical tail, applying full instead of partial rudder boost and fitting an underfin to prevent over rotation. These modifications became standard on all 707 variants and were retrofitted to all earlier 707s. The 37 -420s were delivered to BOAC, Lufthansa, Air-India, El Al and Varig through November 1963; Lufthansa was the first to carry passengers, in March 1960.


A Boeing 707-320B of Pan American World Airways in 1979.
The 707-320B saw the application of the JT3D turbofan to the Intercontinental but with aerodynamic refinements. The wing was modified from the −320 by adding a second inboard kink, a dog-toothed leading edge, and curved low drag wingtips instead of the earlier blunt ones.[14] These wingtips increased overall wingspan by three feet. Takeoff gross weight was increased to 328,000 lb (149,000 kg). The 175 707-320B aircraft were all new-build; no original −320 models were converted to fan engines in civilian use. First service was June 1962, with Pan Am.

The 707-320B Advanced is an improved version of the −320B, adding the three-section leading-edge flaps already seen on the −320C. These reduced takeoff and landing speeds and altered the lift distribution of the wing, allowing the ventral fin found on earlier 707s to be deleted. From 1965 -320Bs had the uprated −320C undercarriage allowing the same 335,000 lb (152,000 kg) MTOW. These were often identified as 707-320BA-H.


Ecuatoriana de Aviación 707-321C in January 1987
The 707-320C has a convertible passenger–freight configuration, which became the most widely produced variant of the 707. The 707-320C added a strengthened floor and a new cargo door to the −320B model. The wing was fitted with three section leading edge flaps which allowed the deletion of the underfin. Three hundred thirty-five of these variants were built, including a small number with JT3D-7 engines (19,000 lb or 84.6 kN takeoff thrust) and a takeoff gross weight of 335,000 lb (152,000 kg). Ironically, most −320Cs were delivered as passenger aircraft, airlines hoping that the cargo door would increase second hand values. The addition of two additional emergency exits, one on either side aft of the wing raised the maximum passenger capacity to a theoretical 219. Only a few aircraft were delivered as pure freighters. One of the final orders was by the Iranian Government for 14 707-3J9C aircraft capable of VIP transportation, communication, and in-flight refuelling tasks.

The 707-700 was a test aircraft used to study the feasibility of using CFM International CFM56 engines on a 707 airframe and possibly retrofitting existing aircraft with the engine. After testing in 1979, N707QT, the last commercial 707 airframe, was restored to 707-320C configuration and delivered to the Moroccan Air Force as a tanker aircraft via a "civilian" order. Boeing abandoned the retrofit program, since it felt it would be a threat to the Boeing 757 program. The information gathered from testing led to the eventual retrofitting of CFM56 engines to the USAF C-135/KC-135R models, and some military versions of the 707 also used the CFM56. The Douglas DC-8 "Super 70" series with CFM56 engines was developed and extended the DC-8's life in a stricter noise regulatory environment. So there are more DC-8s in service than 707s now.[citation needed]

The 707-620 was a proposed domestic range-stretched variant of the 707-320B. The 707-620 was to carry around 200 passengers while retaining several aspects of the 707-320B. It would have been delivered around 1968 and would have also been Boeing's answer to the stretched Douglas DC-8 Series 60. Had the 707-620 been built, it would have cost around $8,000,000 in US currency.[31] However, engineers discovered that a longer fuselage and wing meant a painstaking redesign of the wing and landing gear structures. Rather than spend money on upgrading the 707, engineer Joe Sutter stated the company "decided spending money on the 707 wasn't worth it". The project was cancelled in 1966 in favor of the newer Boeing 747.[32]

The 707-820 was a proposed intercontinental stretched variant of the 707-320B. It was to be powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D-15 turbofan engines and would have had a 10-foot (3.0 m) extension in wingspan. Two variations were proposed, the 707-820(505) model and the 707-820(506) model. The 505 model would have had a fuselage 45 feet (14 m) longer than the 707-320B and would have carried 209 passengers in mixed-class configuration and 260 passengers in all-economy configuration. The 506 model would have had a fuselage 55 feet (17 m) longer than the 707-320B and would have carried 225 passengers in mixed class configuration and 279 passengers in all economy configuration. Like the 707-620, the 707-820 was also set to compete with the stretched DC-8s. The design was being pitched to American, TWA, BOAC and Pan Am at the time of its proposal in early 1965.[33] The 707-820 would have cost $10,000,000 in US currency.[31] Just like the 707-620, the 707-820 would have required a massive structural redesign to the wing and gear structures. The 707-820 was also cancelled in 1966 in favor of the 747.[32]

Main articles: C-137 Stratoliner, E-3 Sentry, E-6 Mercury, E-8 Joint STARS and Air Force One
The militaries of the United States and other countries have used the civilian 707 aircraft in a variety of roles, and under different designations. (Note the 707 and U.S. Air Force's KC-135 were developed in parallel from the Boeing 367–80 prototype.)

The Boeing E-3 Sentry is a U.S. military airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft based on the Boeing 707 that provides all-weather surveillance, command, control and communications.

The VC-137C variant of the Stratoliner was a special-purpose design meant to serve as Air Force One, the secure transport for the President of The United States of America. These models were in operational use from 1962 to 1990. The two aircraft remain on display: SAM 26000 is at the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio and SAM 27000 is at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.

The Canadian Forces also operated the Boeing 707 with the designation CC-137 Husky (707-347C) from 1971 to 1997.

Boeing 717 was the company designation for C-135 Stratolifter and KC-135 Stratotanker derivatives of the 367-80. The designation was later re-used in renaming the McDonnell Douglas MD-95 to Boeing 717 after the company was merged with Boeing.

See also: List of Boeing 707 operators
Boeing's customer codes used to identify specific options and livery specified by customers was started with the 707, and has been maintained through all Boeing's models. In essence the same system as used on the earlier Boeing 377, the code consisted of two digits affixed to the model number to identify the specific aircraft version. For example, Pan American World Airways was assigned code "21". Thus, a 707-320B sold to Pan Am had the model number 707-321B. The number remained constant as further aircraft were purchased; thus, when Pan American purchased the 747-100 it had the model number 747-121.

In the 1980s, the USAF acquired around 250 used 707s to provide replacement turbofan engines for the KC-135E Stratotanker program.[34]

The 707 is no longer operated by major airlines. A total of 10 aircraft were in commercial service with Saha Airlines (3), Hewa Bora Airways (2), and operators with one aircraft as of July 2013.[35] American actor John Travolta owns an ex-Qantas 707-138B, registration N707JT; he is also qualified to fly it as second in command.[36][37] Meraj Airlines has two Boeing 707s in their fleet as a VIP aircraft.[citation needed]

Main article: Aircraft in fiction; Boeing 707
The 707 is mentioned in the songs "Boeing Boeing 707", written and performed by Roger Miller; "Jet Airliner", written by Paul Pena and performed by the Steve Miller Band; and "Early Morning Rain", written by Gordon Lightfoot and popularized by artists such as Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, and Peter, Paul and Mary.

The aircraft has had major roles in the Airport and Airplane films, and has been alluded to in both television and theatrical movies. In 2011, the American television series Pan Am takes place in the early and mid-1960s and features interior sets and exterior CGI representations of the 707 on the ground and in flight; it was Pan Am's frontline airliner during that time. Additional footage of John Travolta's Boeing 707 in Pan Am livery has also been used in the TV series.[45]

            <Title>10: Weather</Title>
            <Text>Pamela and I spent the entirety of the storm spinning up and down in opposition to the weather.  The flight would smooth out and we would get more and more agitated, resolved to do something, anything.  The shaking and dips would resume, keeping us in our seats and giving us time to talk through how little we could do.
And what could we do, really?
We could have the pilots land the airplane at the nearest airport so we could get the woman to an airport.  But landing in this kind of weather might be riskier than just continuing on.  Aside from that, we didn’t know anything about the woman’s situation.  She could be on the way to a specialist in Miami.  She could be terminal, just trying to get home to her family before it was too late.
We ran through a dozen scenarios, each more tragic and unsolvable than the last.
In the end we agreed to wait out the weather.  We’d approach the man, presuming he was still awake, and ask if we could do anything for her.
The time dragged on.  I switched over to thinking of time in Eastern, meaning the last of the turbulence would smooth out around 4am.
Once we had resolved to wait, conversation dried up.  Each of us was too wrapped up in our own thoughts, and I think we both recognized that we were just feeding into each other’s hysteria.
Pamela sat, statuesque in both form and stillness, staring into Coach.
I fidgeted, absently riffling the pages of my textbook with my fingernails.
Somehow, we survived until the destination galley clock read 3:55.  A ding! sounded and we both looked up to see the Fasten Seat Belts sign wink out.
We were both up and in the aisle within moments.  Mr. Duchesne stood up from 21C and smiled as he waited for us to pass.  I gave him a half wave and saw that Pamela had her perfect smile back in place.  I’d gotten to see behind that mask for a while, but it was firmly back in place.
We arrived at 18D to find the entire row fast asleep.  Pamela took a moment, and even though I couldn’t see a trace of it on her face I knew we were both struggling with the same decision: we wanted to wake up the man anyway.
Pamela’s eyes closed in a blink that lasted too long before reopening back to her pleasant but inscrutable self.  She tipped her head in the direction of First Class, so I followed her.
Terry was seated in one of the jump seats, though he was no longer belted in.  The seat next to him contained the remnants of a newspaper.  It looked like he had spent his time during the storm reading every article on every page.
Have I mentioned how boring these overnight flights can get?
He saw us approaching and bent to give the pile of newspaper pages a quiet shuffle to try to line them up for folding.  It looked to be an impossible task, so he stopped trying to work with the creases and just made his own.  He stood to greet us.
“Ladies.  How was Coach?”
I deferred to Pamela, who asked “Do you know the elderly woman in 18E?”
“Sure,” he nodded, “Mrs. Hamilton.  Is everything all right?”
As Pamela related her experience I worked to clear a lump out of my throat.  Hamilton was the name he’d told me in my dream.
You saw it on the manifest or her ticket.  Must have.
I stepped into the galley to get a cup of water.  Pamela wrapped up her story and I stepped forward to rejoin the conversation.
“The man,” I said, “Mr. …” and I let it hang there, staring at Terry to prompt him to supply the name.  As long as it wasn’t—
“Dearborn.”
My mouth dried out in an instant and I fumbled my words, laughing.  I sipped my water and continued.
“Do you think we should wake him up?”
Part of my mind saw Terry look at his watch and shake his head.  He said something, but I lost it.  The rest of my brain flashed back to when we had boarded.
I’d gotten to Sea-Tac just after 7:30 and had made my way to the gate.  The crew was already aboard the aircraft working through preflight checks.  We did introductions and Terry had told me that they were set up and ready to go.  Terry, Pamela, and I went back into the terminal while the pilots headed back into the cockpit.
We started boarding procedures.  HDA boards front to back, just like most airlines who offer multi-class service.  I was taking tickets, checking them against the manifest, and handing passengers off to Pamela.  We’d made it to row 14 before I felt a tap on my shoulder.
An unsmiling man in a business suit and a young woman in an HDA terminal crew uniform stood behind me.  The man’s name tag announced his name to be Ben, but the more important thing had been the stylized series of engraved letters above his name: PRUFA.  It stood for Pacific Regional Union of Flight Attendants, the same name on my paychecks.  I excused myself from the man holding his ticket out to me and the young woman took over.
I hadn’t made it to row 18.  I hadn’t taken the tickets of Mrs. Hamilton, Mr. Dearborn, or Ms. Keats.
Maybe it was possible.  I could have seen their names a few lines down.
I snapped back to the conversation as Terry was saying “I’ll keep an eye on her.”
Pamela nodded and turned to step past me into the galley.  I noticed that the destination clock now read a quarter after four.  If I remembered it right, we’d be somewhere around Corpus Christie by now, just about to cut across the Gulf of Mexico, if we weren’t already over water.
That was it, then.  We’d land in less than three hours and do what we could to help until then.
“I’m going to head back to Coach,” I said to no one in particular and turned to leave.  I heard newspaper crumple behind me but it didn’t sound like Terry was following.
My walk was slow and I took time to look at the faces of almost each and every passenger as I passed their rows.
No one in First Class was still awake.  The woman in Smoking who had been doing needlepoint was now asleep, as was one of the men who had been reading.  The other two were still awake, though one had shifted from his book to what looked like a crossword from a newspaper.
Dearborn, Hamilton, and Keats were all still asleep.
Mr. Duchesne was back in his seat, and while he wasn’t asleep he was working to arrange his pillow and blanket to do so.  I bent down to help arrange his blanket and he gave me a sleepy smile and “thanks”.
The businesswoman from 27A was not in her seat and as I approached the lavatories I could see that one was occupied.
I’d been sitting for two hours through the storm, so I wasn’t ready to sit back down again.  Instead, I stepped out of the aisle and leaned against the cupboards in the galley.
A small gasp made me look up.  The businesswoman from 27A was standing in the door of the lavatory, hand to her chest.  She closed the door behind her and stepped to me.
“Sorry,” I whispered.  “I didn’t mean to frighten you.  I was up front for a bit and just got back.”  I gave her the best smile I could muster at four in the morning.
She waved my apology away.
“Sugar,” she said with an accent that conjured images of plantations and parasols, “I think I might be catching a chill.  Would you mind if I got my coat?”
“Of course, but I could also get you a few blankets if you prefer. So you don’t wrinkle your coat?”
“Bless your heart, that’s so sweet.  But it’s not that precious to me and it’s quite comfortable.”
I pointed with two fingers at the door in front of me and then another to my right.
“Which closet?”
She indicated the one in front of me.
“That one, behind my seat.  Cashmere, in avocado green.”
I opened the door to the coat closet and flipped through the rack.  Hers was easy enough to pick out, even in the low light.
“That’s gorgeous,” I said as I handed it to her.  It was a thick weave and surprisingly heavy.  “But will you get too warm?”
“That corner is freezing.  I will be good.  Thank you so much.”
I offered to help her into it.  As she shouldered it on I noticed that it had an inner silk lining in a darker green.  This coat probably cost more than I paid for an entire year of college courses.
She stepped to return to her seat, but then turned to face me again.  She looked at my name tag.
“Lily, I almost forgot.  Someone was sick in the restroom.”  She pointed to the one closest to the door.  “It looks like they got most of it cleaned up, but not quite.”  Her frown was conspiratorial.  “Sorry.”
It was my turn to wave off her words.
“It’s fine.  It happens.  Thank you for letting me know.”
I pulled the disinfectant from the storage next to the coat closet, along with a plastic bag that held a hand towel-sized rag.
I didn’t smell anything as I opened the door to the lavatory, almost always a good sign.  The messes left by sick air travelers all have very distinct and unpleasant smells.
It didn’t look like there was any vomit in the sink.  I pulled up the lid to the toilet, but—
The explosion threw me into the mirror.  The door slammed closed, rebounded wide open, and slammed closed again.  I dropped the disinfectant bottle and rag, hands going to my ears as they popped.  I rotated, falling into a sitting position on the toilet, dazed and staring up into space.  A misty white cloud poured into the lavatory along the ceiling. I couldn’t help it—I started screaming, joining my voice with those I could hear over the rush of the wind.
The room around me squealed and screeched.  Combined with the howl of the wind, it was deafening.  I kept my hands jammed to my ears, but there was no way to block out the cacophony.
My breath started to come in gasps.  The air felt so thin and cold against my throat.
Air.  I needed to get to oxygen.  There was some in the bottom of the storage cabinet I’d just been in.
I steadied myself against the walls and pushed to my feet.  That same force to the side—it was a flat spin—seemed so much worse back here.  I struggled to open the door against it.  My fingers and toes started to go numb, making it even harder to walk or keep hold on anything to stay upright.
I made it out of the lavatory and rounded the corner, reaching for the storage closet.
But the closet wasn’t there.  Its forward wall was gone, just a drop into empty space.
My knees gave out on me and I fell back into the galley.  My hands were numb to the forearm now, but I managed to prop myself up enough to see the hole.
It was unreal, like Godzilla had taken a bite out of the airplane.
Through the hole, I could see a string of lights swung in and out of view.  I realized with a start that it was a coastline, however many thousands of feet below us.
I closed my eyes and choked back a sob as I realized that the drumbeat pounding had started in my head again.
It was happening all over again.  What kind of a nightmare was this?  What was happening to me?
The percussion built, masking out the world around me.</Text>

        <Document ID="6">
            <Title>1: Cruising Altitude</Title>
            <Text>The speaker crackled and my ears perked up, the response Pavlovian—uncontrollable.
“Ladies and gentlemen we have reached cruising altitude.”
My eyes stared at the public address speaker on the wall ahead of me while my hands pulled my bookmark from the back of my book and slid it into place on the current page.
“I’m turning off the No Smoking sign in the forward cabin,” the ding! chimed over the PA in the same cadence as the man’s speech, as if it was just another piece of punctuation in his sentence, “and I’d like everyone to keep in mind that the rear is a smoke-free section.  I’m also turning off the seatbelt sign,” another well-timed ding, “so smokers in the rear can come forward as needed.  As you do, please close the curtains behind you for the comfort of those in the rows closest to the smoking section.”
The PA clicked off but no one moved.  Despite the garbling the PA did to the pilot’s voice, even the attendants who were used to it had to strain to understand, the tone of his voice made it obvious he wasn’t finished.  There was a burst of static before the pilot’s voice continued.
“It looks like we have some weather over the midwest, so we’re going to head south for a bit instead of taking a direct route.  It’s going to get bumpy in an hour so plan ahead and have that last smoke for the night before then.  We’ll be in the air just over 8 hours tonight, which will put us into Miami shortly after sunrise around seven o’clock tomorrow morning.  Until then, have a drink, get some sleep, and we’ll handle the rest.”
I hadn’t even unbuckled my seat belt before I heard the next ding!, this one in a different tone and accompanied by a small blue light on a panel on the starboard galley wall.  I stowed my thick textbook in its usual place, wedged into the jump seat’s recessed alcove as I closed it.  I double-checked that my face was on before I peeked around the corner and scanned for a matching blue light above the passengers.  I found the seat, 18E.  No one in the area looked frantic, so I made a mental note to follow up after my service prep.
The older gentleman from 21C unbuckled, stood, and shuffled toward me.  Or, I guessed from the strained look on his face, toward the lavatories behind me.  I stepped into the galley to get out of his way and was already half-way through making a pot of coffee before my brain caught up with my hands.  I felt someone’s presence behind me and spoke without turning around.
“You want to get 18E?  Or prep for service?”
There was an almost inaudible snort before responding.
“It looks like you’ve got prep started.” It came out “stah-tid” with the Australian’s accent erasing the “r” while drawing out the first syllable.  “The cart’s behind you.”  Except it came out “ca-at” and “ya”.  I couldn’t help but smile at it.
Another voice came over the PA, this time a woman’s.
“Ladies and gentlemen, we’re going to do a quick beverage service before we turn out the lights for the evening.  We know it took longer than anyone liked to get off the ground, so High Desert Air would like to offer adults one complimentary beverage to take the edge off.”
There was a small cheer and the background noise in the cabin went up a notch.  I knew about the offer and had already started loading the cart with tiny bottles of rum, gin, whisky, and vodka.  HDA didn’t have the operating budget to stock the good stuff, nor anything too outside of the norm.  I doubt the decision to give away what would probably amount to 50 to 75 free alcoholic drinks was easy, but it didn’t take a Harvard Business degree to know that losing customers over a two-hour delay on the tarmac was not an option for the already struggling airline.
“We’ll bring out the cart in just a moment.  And like the captain said, if you’re going to smoke you should do it now before we hit the weather—the cart’s going to make it tricky.”
I heard the sound of a dozen seat belts unbuckling at once, followed by several fumbled “excuse me” voices.  I continued to load the cart on auto-pilot, my awareness focused on my schoolwork.  The ten minutes between takeoff and cruising altitude hadn’t gotten me far into the chapter, and I still couldn’t see the path from what I’d read to what I knew my homework was.
It’s a cache priming problem, I thought as I pulled a bag of ice out of the freezer.  There are N passengers, each with a probability P of ordering a drink.  The range of drink orders is the set O, which includes all combinations of rum R, whiskey W, vodka V, gin G, tonic T, soda water S, cola C, and most important of all: ice I.  How do you stock the beverage cart B, which is really just a cache, to maximize the orders that can be filled from the cart, minimizing the number of cache misses M—how many times I have to walk back here to the galley to restock the cart—without knowing the drink orders up front?
Speaking of up front, I knew Pamela would already be in First Class doing exactly that: taking drink orders with her cactus-green HDA notepad and natural brown pencil.  She could get away with that with her 22 souls.  Terry and I had Coach and 129 souls—it was just more efficient, and visible, to make a best guess with the cart and restock later.
A throat cleared behind me, followed by an “excuse me”.
I turned to find a young man, a few years younger than me anyway.  I seem to remember him seated somewhere to port in the low teens, in one of the exit rows, maybe?  I made eye contact with him and he immediately looked down.  His eyes landed on my chest and locked on my name badge before he blushed and looked away.  I’d seen eyes follow that path for the six months I’d been flying and no longer reacted to it.
“Yes, sir?”
His eyes came back up to my face but bounced around it and the galley wall behind me like a billiard ball.
“Do you, um, I mean of course you do, but,” he stammered.  In the time it took him to get that far, I’d already parsed his accent: Indiana, Illinois, or thereabouts.  He looked 22, but he sounded more like 17.  I’d have to card him if he ordered alcohol. “I mean, um, what’s the movie tonight?”  He added a hasty “ma’am?” at the end that made me think he was straight out of an Indiana corn field.
“Sorry, but we won’t be offering a film tonight.  We don’t usually offer them on our overnight flights, so the bright screens won’t keep anyone up.”  I also knew a third of HDA’s 707 fleet had busted projection equipment, and fewer in-flight movies meant less money paid out in royalties.
His face dropped, and his eyes did the face-chest-floor skip again.  He mumbled an awkward “thanks” before turning around and walking back toward his seat.  But he only got a few steps before he stopped and his shoulders slumped.  He turned around and stepped back to me.
“Lily?”
My name.  Here comes the special request.
“Is it okay if we switch seats?”
I stopped scooping ice into the bucket.  “Is there a problem with your seat?”
He frowned and his eyes met mine for a beat before deflecting to the cart between us.
“My par-, I mean, I got a seat in the smoking section.  But I don’t smoke anymore, and, well, …”
My grip on the ice scoop released from the death-grip I hadn’t realized I’d had.  This was an easy request, and my heart went out to the kid.  My grandfather had quit, and un-quit, more times than I could count when I was growing up.
“We’ve got a full flight tonight.  But you know what you can do?”  I pointed at the indistinct shapes standing behind the translucent curtain between us and the smoking section.  “Those passengers standing by the curtain are probably smokers with seats back here.  You could ask one of them to switch with you.”
He turned to look and seemed to perk up.
“Yeah, I can do that.  Thanks, uh, Lily.”
“Of course.  Let me know if you can’t find someone.  I can ask around for you, too.”
He seemed mollified by this and went back to his seat.  I’d remembered correctly: 13A, over the port wing, exit row seating.  He was a tall kid—when did I downgrade him from “young man” to “kid”?—so it made sense that his parents had gotten him exit row seating.
I heard a lavatory door open a close, followed by a tap on my shoulder.  I expected the elderly gentleman from 21C and turned to find I’d been correct.  He seemed more at ease than when he’d gone in, so the worry that I’d have to clean up a mess evaporated almost as fast as it had solidified.
“Yes, sir?”
“Do you have a paper?”
His eyes never left my face and I couldn’t help but compare that comfortable gaze with the nervous and shifting gaze of 13A.  I turned to look in the rack on the door of the coat closet next to the galley.  It had a handful of magazines but no paper.  As I turned back to the man I caught a blur of motion by the cart.  A surreptitious glance down at my stocks showed me down by two small bottles.
I could confront him.  We were giving away the drinks tonight—why did he need to steal them?  Or … I raised an eyebrow at him and lifted one cheek into a knowing smirk.  I felt it long enough to make it obvious to him that I knew exactly what had happened.  He wasn’t embarrassed, but nor was he cocky.
“Nervous flyer, mister … ?”
“Duchesne.”  He held out a hand which I would have sworn should have held the two bottles but was empty.  “But Jim is fine.”
Jim Duchesne, 21C.  Got it.
“I was an aerospace engineer for 25 years.  Let’s just say I know how old this plane is and what that means.”
I didn’t have a response for that.  I think my face may have slipped from amused smirk to impressed incredulity.
“Well I’ve only been flying for 6 months, but I can say I haven’t had any problems like that so far.”
His shrug was noncommittal.
“It looks like we don’t have a paper back here, but I’ll check when I go forward.  I’ll bring one back if we have one.”
He inclined his head in thanks and turned to head back to his seat.
A few minutes and a few more questions later and the cart was stocked.  By the time Terry made it back to me my brain had finished the shift from homework to flight work and I was ready to get service done so we could put people to sleep.
“What did 18E want?”
“Extra blankets.  The poor dear, she looks terrified.  I don’t think she’s ever flown before.”  He took stock of the cart as he spoke.  He frowned at something before picking up two cans of cola and handing them to me.  “Swap these out for sugar-free.  This stuff will keep people up all night.”
I shrugged and nodded in acknowledgment.  “Good point.”
I reached for the can storage, but a ding! stopped me.  A blue light showed on the wall panel.  As I switched out the cans, Terry scanned the overheads for the call light.
“18E again.  She’s going to be some work.”
“We should see what she wants before we start service.  I can do it.”
I unwedged myself from behind the cart and put on my best face as I walked the 7 rows to 18.  The lady sitting in E, the middle seat, looked ancient.  Her skin was pale and papery, a sheen of sweat on her forehead.  The window seat next to her was empty—likely a smoker getting in their last cigarette for the evening.  The middle-aged man on the aisle in D was reading a magazine and completely disinterested.
But me?  As soon as I saw the woman my alarm bells started screaming.  I couldn’t put my finger on it—it wasn’t danger or fear.  Or it was fear, but not for myself.  Something made me fear for this woman.  She didn’t look sick, but by no accounts did she look well.
I reached under the overhead and deactivated the call light.  Something told me to squat down to get eye level with the woman.  I’m a tall girl, and towering over her sent the wrong impression.  We’re not supposed to squat, but I couldn’t help myself.
“How may I help you, ma’am?”
Her voice quivered, soft and broken.
“My medication.”  Each phrase was punctuated with a breath and a motion of several layers of blankets wrapped atop her.  “For my heart.  In my bag.”  A weak finger pointed up from a hand that didn’t let go of the wrap.
I nodded and was out of the squat and reaching for the overhead before my brain caught up with me.  Fetching carry-ons from the overhead shelf for passengers was discouraged, and a bad idea as a general rule.  I saw that the man in 18D had put his magazine in his lap and leaned over to the woman.
“Are you sure you’re okay?”  His voice was a whisper which I doubt was heard outside of the three of us.
The overhead held a briefcase and two purses.  Damn.  This is why we don’t touch passenger items—I couldn’t be sure which was hers and I didn’t want the lady from 18F to walk back up to us and see me holding her bag.
Wait, I could tell.  One purse was leather, bulky and professional.  The other was cotton, well-worn, and the same shade of lavender as the collar sticking out from under 18E’s blanket.
“The lavender bag, ma’am?”
18E gave the tiniest of nods as she sucked another breath through her teeth.
The bag was wedged between the leather purse and briefcase, and took some shimmying to get loose.  I reached up to put a second hand around it when I felt a buzz and the ring finger on my right hand went numb.  My hand jerked back and I stared at it.  Nothing was wrong with it and it was already regaining feeling.  I shook it, flexing and curling it in front of my eyes.
The man in 18D looked up at me, snapping me back into what I had been doing.  I pulled the bag down and began to hand it to the woman.
“I can help her,” said 18D as he intercepted the bag.
I looked to the woman for confirmation, and only released my hold on the bag after she nodded at me and gave a shaky smile.  I looked back at the man, staring into his eyes, searching for something that would make me feel okay about leaving him to care for the woman.
He seemed to realize what I wanted and his eyes widened for a brief moment before he smiled at me and looked to my name tag.
“Thanks, Lily.  I didn’t realize she’d forgotten, but I can help her from here.  Could she get some water?”
I nodded and walked back, still too thrown off balance to say anything.  I curled and uncurled my hand, even though it already felt normal again.  Terry gave me an inquisitive look as I approached.
“Everything on the up and up?”
I bit my lip, considering my response while pouring water from the pitcher into a small plastic cup.
“We should keep an eye on her.  She doesn’t look well.”  I held up a finger to signal that I’d be right back, then walked to 18.
The man in 18D had the purse open on his lap.  It had the usual detritus I’d gotten used to seeing in my grandmother’s purse: makeup cases, tissues, something in a royal purple leather that was probably the corner of a wallet.  18D was struggling to open a dark orange prescription bottle.  I reached past him to put down the tray from the seat in front of her, placing the water into its divot.
The pills in the bottle were huge, dry and chalky-looking things.  I didn’t envy her having to swallow them.  The man had gotten the top off and was reviewing the label.
“Two?”  he asked her, receiving a nod.
His eyes came back to mine and he gave me a nod before returning his focus to the woman.
I looked to Terry and gave him a similar nod.  He acknowledged and unlocked the cart wheels, pushing it toward me.  He didn’t speak until we’d gotten to 7, the first row in the smoking section.
“Good to go?”
I wasn’t sure what I thought about the encounter, so I gave him a squint and head tilt meant to communicate let’s talk later.  He acknowledged it with a mirrored head tilt before putting on his face and turning to 9A to take a drink order from the man sitting there.  I took a moment to do the same, though I admit it took longer than I would have liked.
The man in 7A was already looking at me, cigarette between his fingers dangling lazy and half-forgotten next to his face.
“Good evening, sir.  What can—“
“Vodka tonic, sweetie.”

            <Title>7: Weather</Title>
            <Text>I could feel the gentle bank to port just as I stowed the last of the leftover drinks.  I added two miniature bottles of gin by pushing back a half-dozen bottles of rum, which I’d run back from the cart on an earlier trip to the galley when it had become clear we were going to need far more vodka.  Terry had been a Bloody Mary salesman, convincing passengers that the sugar in the rum would keep them up and that the tomato juice was as close as they’d come to dinner service for the evening.  Between his accent and his sense of humor he got away with more irreverence than I thought I could ever pull off.
“What was with the Bloody Marys?”
His mustache gained a conspiratorial smirk and his reply was barely audible.
“The tomato mix is on its way out.  I wanted to get rid of it.”
“I hadn’t noticed.  Good catch.”
A woman in her late forties, who I remembered as being in 15 or 16 E or F, squeezed around Terry to get to the lavatory.  His eyes bulged as she passed and there was a slight hitch as he wiped the condensation off the now-empty ice bucket.  I’d been in that position enough times to know exactly what had happened.  His jaw tightened for an instant, confirming without words.  He moved around the cart, into the entrance to the galley and well out of the path to the aisle.
When the woman came back out of the lavatory I had to suppress a snicker.  It was obvious that the woman had removed her bra.  Terry made a polite smile and nod in her direction, handing me the last of the serviettes from the cart.  The woman didn’t so much walk past him in as much as she sauntered, making sure he could see every stretch and slide of fabric against her.  She flicked an eyebrow at me as she passed.
I broke the silence with a whispered “well, then” as I slid the cart into its home beneath the galley counter.
Terry was unreadable—he could have been interested, disgusted, amused, or anything else.  His eyes locked on the same lavatory door the woman had just exited.  He walked over to it and peeked inside.
“Did you think she’d left a mess?” I asked when he rejoined me a moment later.
His response was more exasperated than I was expecting.
“No, worse.  I was worried she’d left me a present.”
My eyes widened at the idea.  Who just strips off their bra and then leaves it in a restroom for a guy to find?
“It wouldn’t be the first time,” he sighed.
I choked back a laugh and had an idea.  I grabbed for the PA microphone.
“Ladies and gentlemen, we’re about to dim the lights for the evening.  Terry is going to make one more pass through the cabin to pick up any leftover service items.  This will also be your last chance for the restroom before we hit some bumpy weather in 20 minutes.  Try to get a good night’s sleep and we’ll see you in Florida.”
Only two passengers made their way back to the lavatories.  Everyone else was either content or already asleep.
I scrubbed my hands in the tiny galley sink—no matter how careful I was, I always felt like I ended up with my hands covered in beverage after service.  I looked around for stray items, but we’d cleaned up well.  Nothing was going to rattle around when the weather hit.  I managed to waste another ten minutes before giving up and going back to my jump seat.
I sat there, textbook on my lap but unable to concentrate enough to read.
What was that?  There’s no way it was a dream, right?
Try as I might, I had trouble coming up with anything specific that I remembered happening before the crash.  It was just another normal flight.  We had hit the turbulence just when the pilot said we would.  Which pilot had it been?  It couldn’t have been an hour and a half ago, but that faint-dream-thing made it feel like the full eight hours had passed.
Lawrence.  Lawrence was the name of the pilot.
I’d met him during preflight, before the passengers boarded and before the union rep showed up.  Right.  He’d introduced himself as Lawrence and then introduced his co-pilot, Stephen.  No.  Simon.  That was it.  Lawrence and Simon.  Lawrence I remembered because I’d seen his name tag as he’d approached and I’d thought it was odd that someone would go by Lawrence instead of Larry.  Then he’d spoken, with his erudite enunciation and prince-like politeness, and that mystery had been solved.
Wait.  You’re getting off track.
I was trying to remember specific things that had happened between service and the … incident.  The accident.  Even thinking the words “the explosion” made my jaw clench.
We’d had weather for something like two hours, the kind I think of as checkerboard weather.  We’d hit clear patches, then rough, then clear again, cycling a half dozen times.  It had been enough to warrant the Fasten Seatbelts sign, but not enough to stand out.  I’d been reading for most of it, but I didn’t see too many people shifting in their seats.  I was confident that most passengers had slept through it.
Terry had taken the jump seat next to mine.
He had a book.  What was it?
I tried to picture it in my mind.  It was a paperback, on the thick side.  White cover.  Red letters, maybe silver?  Maybe silver letters with a red drawing?  Or the reverse?
It wasn’t coming to me.  I hadn’t paid attention.  My nose had been buried in my textbook in the low light, head focused on working through the homework assignment.  Terry had made one or two attempts to have a conversation, but I couldn’t remember any details.  I doubt I had been very good company, as distracted as I’d been.  He’d gone back to his book and I to mine.
After the two-plus hours of weather, we’d had another two and a half of clear air.  Again, I couldn’t come up with anything specific that had happened.  Maybe another three or four passengers had gone past me into one of the lavatories, but I hadn’t paid much attention to who or which.
By the time I’d gotten up to stretch at something like six in the morning, Eastern time, nothing at all eventful had happened.
Dreams could be like that, right?  Where you’re in one place one moment, then in another place and another time the next moment?  Just a watery blur between the two?
Except that this didn’t feel quite like that.  It didn’t have that feel of missing time, inasmuch as uninteresting time.
I’d spent the chunk of time, maybe a half hour, getting individual beverages of the non-alcoholic morning variety for passengers as they woke up.  We weren’t going to offer a morning beverage service so instead I’d ferried individual and pairs of orange and apple juices, waters, and colas from the galley.  I’m pretty sure I’d even served one or two tomato juices, which I now wondered about given Terry’s assertion as to its state.
How had I ended up in the First Class galley with Pamela?
Towel service.
Right!  That’s it!  The memories were coming a little easier now, like I’d dislodged a hairball in a clogged drain.
The man in the business suit had asked for a towel to freshen up.  He hadn’t wanted to wait for the now-growing line at the lavatories, so he’d pulled me aside on one of my drink trips and asked if First Class had any left over warm towels.  I’d been embarrassed, as I hadn’t remembered if Pamela was going to do a towel service.  HDA only does it for First Class on overnight flights, but not on all of them.  I’m sure there is a pattern to when we do and when we don’t, but since I almost never work First Class, I hadn’t paid enough attention to spot it.
He’d caught me off guard, so instead of a polite negative I had stammered out an “I’ll check”.
Terry had been running drinks and collecting trash, like me.  I’d asked him about towel service and he’d said he was almost certain we weren’t going to offer it today.  The line for the lavatory was getting to be a problem for getting into and out of the galley, so I’d gotten the passengers into something more orderly and then walked up to First Class to talk to Pamela.
The answer had been obvious from the moment I’d stepped out of Coach—no one in First Class had a towel, and Pamela would have been on top of it—but I was committed and asked her anyway.
That’s when the incident had occurred.  I don’t even remember if I’d gotten the chance to ask her about the towels.
That seems awfully vivid for a dream.
Well, the last part was anyway.  The first part, like any other overnighter, was as uneventful and unmemorable as it gets.
Had it been a premonition?  In the movies and on television when fortune tellers and psychics had visions it seemed like they only ever got flashes of the big events.  They got the highlight reel.  Is there such a thing as a mostly-boring premonition?  If there was, that sounds like it would be my luck.  Sure, I can see the future, but only in real time and only when it’s a snooze-fest.  Up until the end, anyway.
Well, if it was a premonition it was already wrong.  From where I’m sitting I can see the dark patch of carpet where I broke the rum bottle, and I can still smell it.  My “premonition” hadn’t included a broken bottle.  And I’m not one hundred percent certain, but I think Terry and I ended up switching places during drink service—the premonition had me in front and him behind, but we’d just done the opposite.
At least … I think that’s how it happened.  Why hadn’t I paid more attention?
Why would you pay more attention?
It wasn’t like serving bar, where seeing the same customers every night and knowing their favorite drinks would get me more tips.  Sure, I’d seen a few repeat travelers, but not enough times to get to know them.  And since flight attendants don’t get tipped it’s not like I try to make myself stand out with memorable service.  I pride myself on my professional efficiency and courtesy, not on providing some unforgettable experience.
“May I?”
I’d been so wrapped up in my own head that the voice alone made me jump and almost drop my forgotten textbook.  Pamela was pointing at the jump seat next to me, already moving to sit down without waiting for a response.  I recovered, wrangling my book back into my lap, and nodded.
“How are you doing tonight,” I asked, breathless, “everything okay up front?”
Pamela’s perfect passenger-facing plastic smile gained the smallest of mirthful smirks and raised eyebrows, her eyes darting to the right to check her periphery for stray eavesdroppers.
“Terry asked to take over for a while.  He wouldn’t say why,” she paused more for effect than because she expected me to fill in the gap, “but I’ve seen that look on his face before.  I would hazard to guess he has caught the eye of a lady?”
An undignified snort may or may not have escaped me.  I plead the Fifth.
“Yes, I thought so.”
“While I’m thinking about it, question: are you doing a towel service before we land?”
She shook her head, her perfect hair an unmoving testament to patience on a geological scale.  I had a flash memory of walking up the pitched aisle just askance behind her, the wind pulling fly-aways out into a halo a few at a time.  My breath caught at the intensity of the vision.
“No, we didn’t load any towels.”
I might have been mistaken, but I thought I heard the tiniest hint of acid in her response.  Once again, I’d been too distracted inside my own head to pay attention to someone right in front of me.
Concentrate!
She saw something in my expression and tilted her head.
“Why do you ask?”
“I couldn’t remember.  It’s not important now.”
A beat passed, but she spoke again an instant before it would have gotten awkward.
“What’s the book?”</Text>

            <Title>2: Lily</Title>
            <Text>I should have introduced myself.  Sorry about that.  My head was wrapped up in homework, and then service, and well, you know how it goes.  For someone who is paid to have good manners, I’m not as good at it as I ought to be.
My name is Lily.  Liliana Theresa Ramirez Alonso, but no one calls me Liliana who isn’t reading my name off a clipboard.
I’ve been a flight attendant for High Desert Airlines since April, flying since May, for just about six months now.  I admit I’m having a small identity crisis about this.  I never planned to become a stewardess.  Yes, I know we’re supposed to call ourselves flight attendants, but my grandmother referred to herself as a stewardess for my entire childhood so it’s a hard habit to break.
But as I was saying, I didn’t plan for this.  In my head I’m a computer programmer.  That’s what the textbook, “Algorithms and Architecture, 3rd Edition”, is for: my night school course in Programming Data Structures.  According to my transcript, I’m in my junior year with something like 20 credits to go.  But since I’ve had to cut back to a single course each semester, there’s no way I could juggle this job and more than one course at a time, it’s going to take me 6 more semesters, meaning I won’t graduate until December of ’78 if I’m lucky.
Two more years.  That particular finish line seems so much further away than it did when I started.  I’ll be 26 by then.
Yeah, that math doesn’t really work, does it?  What’s a 24-year-old doing still in school?
I graduated in ’70 but we didn’t have the money to send me straight off to school.  Especially not for Computer Science—the textbooks and lab fees are crazy.  I spent a year being stupid, immature, and angry about the whole thing before getting my head on straight.  Then I did 5 years as a waitress, bartender, babysitter, whatever I could do that would put cash in my hand.  Those jobs were also easy enough to do at night while I started going back to school in ’74.
’76 hit me like a freight train.
My grandparents died in a car crash in March.  I’ve lived with them my entire life, as my mom and dad were out of the picture before I was out of diapers.  By May it was clear I wasn’t going to be able to keep paying for school and rent in our place, so one had to go.  I admit the decision to let the house go was probably just as much about how sad it kept making me to look around and not see my grandparents as it was about money.
I needed a job with a flexible schedule and I needed to start thinking about roommates.  Grandma told me so many stories about her time as a stewardess—crash pads with eight girls rotating through four bunk beds in a single room—that it seemed like the easiest choice in the world.  The pay is pretty awful, but to be honest it’s not much worse than scraping by as a waitress.
High Desert Air is owned by some guys who used to be pilots who flew with grandma.  I called them up, ostensibly to let them know about grandma and grandpa, dropped a few hints, and here I am.
HDA is struggling.  From what I hear from other people in the business who have come from other airlines, the entire business isn’t doing so well.  With gas prices being what they are, tickets are expensive and not many people are flying.  Not that you could tell looking at an HDA flight—we’re always completely booked.  We’re the second or third cheapest option flying out of Seattle.  The owners are just guys who loved to fly, rumor is one of them still does when a pilot calls in sick, so they’ll do just about anything to keep the airline going.
Mostly that means old aircraft with few frills.
That’s the other reason everyone was so happy about the free booze: most HDA passengers understand the consequence of their low ticket price and will take what they can get when it’s offered.
I’m making it sound bad.  It’s not.  But it’s not crumpets and tea, either.  Really, it’s just a continuation of the mediocrity and barely-breaking-even theme of ’76.
I know everyone is excited about the bicentennial, but to be honest I am ready for ’77.  It can’t possibly be worse than ’76.</Text>

            <Title>3: After Service</Title>
            <Text>Service was a 40-minute blur.  I checked out somewhere around the third passenger.  When you’re used to being behind a bar keeping a half-dozen orders of far more complex drinks, taking and then serving three at a time requires less brainpower than it does patience.
We stowed the cart and did one last pass through the cabin before Terry got on the PA.
“Lily’s coming through the cabin now to collect any leftover service items.  We’re going to dim the lights so everyone can get some sleep.  We’re going to go through some weather in the next hour, so please be sure to buckle up before you nod off.  Good night, and see you tomorrow morning over Florida.”
As I passed 18, I saw the elderly woman was asleep and the man had gone back to his magazine.  I also saw that in 18F now sat a woman around the same age as the man, late 30s or early 40s.  She had pale, freckled skin and bright red hair pulled back in a severe ponytail, both of which shone under the glare of her reading light.  She turned off her light and smiled as I passed, but something about her brought out a return smile from me that was more plastic than sincere.
“How’s Mrs. Hamilton?” Terry asked as I stepped into the tiny galley alcove with him.  “18E,” he clarified.
“Sleeping.  Do you know if the man and woman are with her?”
“The manifest lists different names, so I don’t think they are related.  I believe his name is Dearborn, Ernest or Edward or something.  The bluey is Jennifer Keats.”
“Bluey?”
His smile was wide behind his thick mustache.  “The red-haired woman.”
“Bluey, huh?  Okay then.”
“Right, well, Dearborn, Hamilton, Keats.”  His hand made little partitioning motions as he said each name, recreating the seating order from the aisle.  “It seemed like Mr. Dearborn and Mrs. Hamilton were friendly.  I didn’t get to see Ms. Keats with them.  She was already in smoking by the time I got there and didn’t sit down until after service.”
“I saw Dearborn give Mrs. Hamilton some horse pills.  She was asleep the next time I saw her during service.”  I ran my tongue along the back of my teeth, lost in thought.  I blinked a few times and snapped out of it.  “Hey, I can get this cleaned up, if you want.”
Terry smiled but shook his head.  “I appreciate the offer,” it came out “oh-fuh” and a part of me took a moment to appreciate that I got to work every day with people from all around the world.  “But I don’t mind.”  He pointed at the jump seats behind me.  “Enjoy your book.  I’ve got this.”
In truth, I wasn’t in the mood to go back to studying, but it wasn’t worth discussing.  These overnighters could go either way.  Most any other flight would find her doing most of the work, as she almost always had less seniority than any of the other crew.  Overnighters were, however, boring beyond belief.  For the next six hours or so, only a handful of passengers would be awake at any time, and their demands on the cabin crew would be minimal.  If Terry wanted something to do to pass the time, that was his right.
In minutes I was buried back into Chapter 13, of something like 40.  We weren’t going to get through the entire book this semester, as the next course would cover the second half.  At least that’s what the clerk in the bookstore had said to calm me down when I’d gotten emotional and loud about textbook prices.  I was a little behind—the final exam was in two weeks and I was supposed to have everything up to Chapter 20 under my belt.  The holidays had been good for my wallet with extra lines that no one else had wanted, but that extra flight time had meant less study time.
Chapter 13 of “Algorithms and Architecture” was about caching, the idea that you could make the trade-off to use some fast but expensive memory to hold data that might be requested from slower but cheaper hard disk drives.  Caching seemed to me like something of a dark art: there was no way to guess exactly which data might be requested more often than others, making the most sense to cache, and which would just waste precious cache space.
My thought experiment with the drinks during service was a good example: we’d ended up using far more vodka than rum, so Terry had made a trip to restock.  I’d predicted poorly, so we’d lost a few minutes here and there to evicting stale cache items (rum) and replacing them with hot items (vodka).
The analogy wasn’t perfect.  In a cache, accessing an item doesn’t consume it like it did for our drink cart.  But it’s close enough.
I liked that this chapter was easy enough to apply to my work.  Some of the other chapters were much less so.  I’ve yet to figure out how recursion could apply to anything in my job.
I’d been rubbing at my temples for a while before I realized it.  The skin there was warm from the activity.  I’d reread the same paragraph two or three times, or probably more like five if I’m honest about it.  I had a headache.
That gave me pause.
I have a headache.
I don’t get headaches.  My grandfather gets them.  Got them.  But not me.  Oh, sure, I’ve gotten the stray headache here and there, but I could count the number in the last five years on one hand.
This one was a low-level pressure.  Almost a throbbing that sort of ran around a racetrack along the inside of my skull.  It didn’t hurt inasmuch as it was just uncomfortable.  And it felt like it kept rolling around up there, unlike the stationary heartbeat throb of headaches I’d had before.
It’s the book, genius.  How many times has grandma told you not to read those tiny letters in this low light?
I could hear her voice, chiding me: “Lily, put down that book.  I can’t get you to eat enough carrots to fix what you’re doing to your eyes.”
I put my bookmark back in place and looked up to find Terry gone from the galley.  A glance to the clocks there, one set to Pacific, told me that I’d lost maybe 45 minutes to reading.  The galley was immaculate, so I checked the lavatories.  All were in reasonable order, with only a few drops of water on the counter here and there to keep them from being considered spotless.  I hadn’t paid much attention while I was reading, but I don’t think more than three or four people had used them in that time.
Terry wasn’t visible in the aisle, so I figured he must have been in First Class visiting Pamela, the third member of our crew.  As we were setting up the cabin in preflight, I’d thought I’d sensed some history between the two.  It could have just been the usual chemistry of a pair of people used to working with each other every day, but it could have been more.  If Terry had been back here I would have asked him about it.
Actually … no, I probably wouldn’t.  I didn’t know either of them well enough for that kind of question.</Text>

            <Title>11: Loop Two</Title>
            <Text>I gasped and fell to my knees as the pressure in my head vanished.
The sound of breaking glass and the sugary smell of cheap rum were followed by Terry’s exclamation of “Lily!”
The pressure may have gone, but I still couldn’t quite focus.  I shook my head to clear out the cobwebs.  It only helped a little.
“I’m fine,” I gasped.  “Sorry.  Just … just give me a sec.”
I stood, shaky, and leaned back against the storage door, once again whole and right where it was supposed to be.
“It was different that time.”
Terry was at my side, hand around my arm.  “What’s that?”
“Nothing, sorry.  Talking to myself.”  I turned to face him, rubbing at my temples.  “Really, I’m fine.  Just low blood sugar, I think.”
He released his grip on my arm but continued to stare at me, focusing on one eye and then the other.
“When was the last time you ate?”
My eyes went to the departure clock in the galley: a few minutes after 9:15pm, Pacific time.
It was either 4 hours ago, 11 hours ago, or 2 hours ago.  It depends on your point of view.
I didn’t have a quick response, which he mistook to mean that I was ashamed of the answer.
“Stay here.  I’ll be right back.”
I considered stopping him, but realized that I was hungry again.  I could use the salad he’d bring back.  These loops, or whatever they were, made me hungry each time they restarted.
Why had the time of the explosion changed?
Although “explosion” was the term going around and around in my thoughts, I supposed that it could have been an explosive decompression.  It could have been a bomb, but it could also have been that some piece of the airframe had succumbed to fatigue and failed.  Several commercial jet crashes had happened because a door lock snapped, or a cargo door hadn’t been sealed.
In the first iteration of the loop the explosion had happened around 6:45 Eastern.  In the second it was around 4:15—two and a half hours earlier.  What changed?
Wait, if it changed … that means it probably wasn’t mechanical failure or weather related.  It was intentional.
It was an explosion!  Of course it was intentional!
I saw Airport with my grandparents when it came out a few years ago.  My grandmother had been so excited to see a movie about air travel.  I had asked her how realistic it was and she had waggled her hand at me.
“It is and it isn’t.”
I’d pressed her about the main plot: a guy with a bomb blows himself up because he thinks his wife will collect his life insurance payout.
“That part,” she had waggled her hand again.  “It might be possible at a regional airport where they don’t have the budget to install the metal detectors or to hire bomb-sniffing dogs.  But on an international flight with that many passengers?  It would be very difficult.  And we are all good at spotting nervous passengers.  Most of the time if they are nervous it is because it is their first time flying.  But we can always tell if they are up to no good.”
I had been dubious at the time, and I don’t know if my experience as a flight attendant had changed that opinion.  Yes, we saw so many travelers that we did begin to get a sense for troublemakers or people who needed an extra comforting smile.  I’d also handled my fair share of drunk and rowdy passengers—I’d learned how to handle them in my time as a waitress and bartender.  But I had never been faced with someone like that bomber: someone who wanted to harm himself or others.
Had I seen anyone acting suspicious enough that I thought they could be capable of trying to blow up the airplane?
Both times, the explosion was back here.
I spun and opened the coat closet.  We’d departed from Seattle in December, so the closet was packed.  There had to have been almost twenty coats of varying sizes, styles, and weights, including the one I had expected to see: avocado green cashmere.  The closet was packed so full that I couldn’t see more than the fabric of each arm.
I dropped into a squat and ran my hands along the floor of the closet.  I knew it was only arms-length deep, but I couldn’t touch the back wall from my position.  As near as I could tell there was nothing on the floor, not even dust bunnies.
“Looking for something?”  Terry’s voice came from the other side of the opened door.
I waved a hand out to the side of the door and stood up, giving myself a moment to come up with an excuse.
“I thought I saw someone throw a carry-on in here when they hung up their coat.  I didn’t want it sliding around when we hit the weather later.  But it’s not here, so I guess I imagined it.”
“Oh,” he said, noncommittal.  He handed me the salad.  “Pamela says you owe her one.”
I took the container, but shot him an eyebrow.  “Pamela said that?”
For a moment I thought he was going to continue the gag, but he gave up.
“Right, that was me.  You owe me one.”
I grabbed a fork from the galley and almost inhaled the salad.  “That sounds more like it,” I got out between bites.
“Slow down, we’ve got time.”
It was too late—the salad was already gone.  I stowed the container.  The departure clock on the galley bulkhead showed 9:27pm Pacific.  I looked up to see Terry sniffing and looking around.
“Do you smell that?”
Rum.  The bottle I’d broken when the loop restarted.  Last time it had made a mess next to the cart.  This time we could smell it but not see it, meaning it was probably under the cart.  I unlocked the wheels and pulled the cart out of the aisle and into the galley.  Sure enough, a broken bottle of rum had made a small dark patch on the carpet.
Terry knelt and picked up the bottle and its severed neck, holding them up to get a better look.
“It looks like a clean break.  I don’t see any fragments in the carpet.  Toss me a rag?”
He sopped up what he could, leaving a patch that was damp but not unsafe for the passengers on their way to the lavatories.
“That reminds me,” I said, and started pulling rum bottles off the cart.
How many did we have left over?
I remembered putting back two bottles of gin, so I grabbed those, too.  I pushed them onto the liquor shelf and started piling rum bottles into my hands until it felt like what I remembered from the last loop.
“We’re going to need those,” Terry said.
“I stocked the cart earlier without thinking.  Like you said, rum will just keep people awake.”
Terry nodded in agreement.  “Bloody Marys.”  He leaned across the cart, conspiratorial.  “I think the tomato mix is on it’s way out, anyway.”
“I was thinking the same thing,” I said, holding up the replacement bottles of vodka and dropping them into place on the cart.

            <Title>8: Pageant Pamela</Title>
            <Text>I should mention that I’ve flown with Pamela twice before.  I don’t think either was a long flight, and she’s always in First Class and both times I’d been in Coach as I am now, so we didn’t get much opportunity to chat and get to know each other.  There’s a reason I’ve always seen her work First Class, and for once it has nothing to do with seniority.
In my mind, Pamela’s full name is Pageant Pamela.  I don’t think I even know her last name, though I admit I must have seen it on a manifest at some point.  It doesn’t matter, because her real last name is immaterial.  Pageant Pamela.  That’s who she is, and anyone who met her would come to the same conclusion.
To be clear, I name her this out of respect, awe, appreciation, and no small amount of jealousy.
Pamela is as close to the flight attendant definition of beauty and perfection as you’re going to get.  As part of my degree program I took a course in computational statistics.  I am therefore qualified to tell you that she’s a standard deviation or three to the far end of the curve.  Even if you make a sample group containing only flight attendants, she’s still off the scale.
She’s six feet even in heels, and I suspect an impressive five-eleven in flats.  She fills out her uniform just enough to catch every man’s eye, but carries herself with so much elegance that it wouldn’t occur to them to mentally remove said uniform.  Her skin has the perfect, tight smoothness of someone my age in her mid-to-late twenties, but speaks with an authority and assuredness that I associate with someone a decade or two older than me.
What kills me is that she makes it seem so effortless.
The beauty standards the airlines hold us to are contested and recently illegal, but you can’t change decades of historical inertia overnight.  We are, for all intents and purposes, an entire industry built on beauty standards and professionalism.  This means we all know we are, as a rule, better looking than average.  Some of us can get wrapped up in that and turn it into an end instead of a means.
When I say Pamela made it look effortless what I mean is that I’d never seen her primp, flirt, or do anything to suggest that her beauty was anything other than a remarkable coincidence.
I, on the other hand … where to begin?
Look, I know I’m not bad on the eyes, but nor am I even in the same league as Pamela.
When I’m not hunched over a book I hit a respectable five-seven in my work heels.  I don’t fill out my uniform in the same statuesque proportions—I feel like I have weak, round shoulders and my waist doesn’t hourglass inwards inasmuch as drop straight down from bust to hips.  The straight black hair I got from my father, or so I’m told, is thick and straight enough that I can do a very professional braid or bun that will stay under control for all but the longest of flights without giving me a driving headache.
If I’m honest, I know I’m to the left side of the mean on the flight attendant curve.  I didn’t get the job because I’m the fairest of them all.  I got it because I’ve worked enough service industry jobs to know how to handle myself, and given enough time in front of a mirror I can get myself just about to that middle line.  I won’t be able to do so forever, but I can hold out for a few more years.</Text>

            <Title>4: Reserve</Title>
            <Text>I should explain reserve.  I’m not doing a very good job at narrating, sorry.
I’m what we call “reserve crew”.  Most crew fly the same lines, sequences of flights that usually start and end at the same place so that the crew can feel like they have some semblance of a place to call home.  Good lines are jealously coveted, and are doled out based on your seniority.  Since I’ve only been in the air for six months, I have almost no chance of getting even a decent line.
Instead, I fly reserve, which means that I fly when other crew can’t or won’t.  Sometimes it’s because they’re sick, sometimes it’s because they’re no longer legal—the FAA has very strict regulations about how much we can work, how often, and how long, and weather can play havoc with it—or any number of other reasons.
I get a call, which I have to return in under 15 minutes, and I have to be at the airport and ready to go in under two hours.  More often than not they want me there even faster than that.  Sometimes I get called into an airport because weather is going crazy and it’s almost a sure thing that at least a few other crew are going to not be legal when they land.  I might sit in a chair, reading my textbook, for four hours before I’m told to go back home, or told to catch a shuttle to a nearby airport because I’m finally needed elsewhere.
Reserve isn’t something everyone can handle.  I don’t mind it so much because, to be honest, I don’t make the interpersonal connections that most other attendants do.  I almost never work with the same crew more than a few days in a row.  HDA isn’t a huge airline, but we do fly to enough places that I can go a week or two before working with the same crew a second time.
Terry and Pamela’s usual third is a woman named Archie.  I think I’ve worked with her before—that’s a unique enough name that it’s hard to forget.  She’d been all but kicked off of the plane when it landed in Seattle earlier this evening.  She was fighting a stomach flu that was serious enough to have her in a lavatory for a third of the Lansing-Seattle flight, according to Terry.  He and Pamela had dragged her off the plane, frog-marched her to the airport hotel, checked her in, and refused to let her leave the room until she’d finally succumbed to the medications they’d pumped into her.
I got the call just as I’d started Chapter 13 and was out the door within ten minutes.  Flying reserve, you get used to being ready to go with a minimum of fuss.
But there was a hitch: I wasn’t quite legal yet.  I’d only just landed in Seattle that morning, so I needed another hour and change before I was allowed to be in the air again.
I was the reason the plane sat on the tarmac for an extra hour and a half.
Okay, well, technically it wasn’t me.  If you looked at it the right way, I was the reason these people were in the air instead of sleeping in Sea-Tac because their flight was cancelled or rescheduled for the following morning.
So when the plane blew up just before sunrise, somewhere off the gulf coast of Florida, I was the reason everyone was dropping several miles into the ocean.</Text>

            <Title>Novel Format</Title>
            <Text>NOVEL FORMAT

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. The necessary settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle e-book.

How To Use This Template
	•	Create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
	•	Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
	•	Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
	•	Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder. You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do - you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely). Instead, to create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way. Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit cmd-N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.

Compiling
	•	Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Research” folders). You will choose different front matter depending on the format to which you are compiling.
	•	Scrivener remembers your compile settings, so you only need to follow the instructions below when you want to compile to a different format. After that, you can just go to File &gt; Compile… and click the “Compile” button straight away.
	•	Tip: You can open this document in a QuickReference panel and have it open alongside the Compile panel if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.

		To compile to standard manuscript format:
	◦	Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (note that it will have been filled in by default with information from Address Book).
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Select “Standard Manuscript Format” from the “Format As” pop-up button if it is not already selected. (If “Novel” is selected, that’s fine too - that’s just the default format for this particular template, which is the same as standard manuscript format.)
	◦	Ensure that the “Summary” tab is selected at the top of the Compile panel. (This isn’t strictly necessary—the below options can also be found in the “Contents” pane of the “All Options” tab.)
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked and select the “Manuscript Format” folder from the pop-up button next to it (this is already selected by default).
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

		To compile to paperback PDF format:
	◦	Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback Novel folder.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Select “Paperback Novel” from the “Format As” pop-up button if it is not already selected.
	◦	Ensure that the “Summary” tab is selected at the top of the Compile panel. (This isn’t strictly necessary—the below options can also be found in the “Contents” pane of the “All Options” tab.)
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked and select the “Paperback Novel” folder from the pop-up button next to it if it is not already selected.
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

		To compile to e-book format:
	◦	Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/E-Book folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
	◦	Import a cover image (the recommended size is 600x800 pixels, preferably in JPG or PNG format). You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “E-Book” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided - you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Select “E-book” from the “Format As” pop-up button if it is not already selected.
	◦	Ensure that the “Summary” tab is selected at the top of the Compile panel. (This isn’t strictly necessary—the below options can also be found in the “Contents”, “Cover” and “Layout” panes of the “All Options” tab.)
	◦	If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked and select the “E-Book” folder from the pop-up button next to it if it is not already selected. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
	◦	If you have imported your own cover image, be sure to select it from the “Cover image” pop-up button.
	◦	If you don’t want an HTML table of contents included, un-tick “Generate HTML table of contents”. This must be ticked when exporting to Kindle format but is less necessary when exporting to EPUB format, because most EPUB readers generate their own table of contents anyway.
	◦	From the “Compile for” pop-up button, choose whether to export to EPUB or Kindle format.
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
	•	Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be customised by going to Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings… and choosing the “Project Properties” tab.
	•	Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the “All Options” tab of the Compile sheet and deselect “Title” in the list of elements to include.
	•	Page header and footer: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile sheet (under “All Options”).
	•	Page size: The “Paperback Novel” format is set to export to a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with CreateSpace. You can customise this by clicking on the “Page Setup…” button in the “Page Settings” pane of Compile.
	•	Font: You can use “Quick Font Override” in Compile to change the font used throughout the final document (this is available from both the “Summary” and “All Options” tabs). Note that fonts are not included in e-books, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a particular font in an e-book).
	•	Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are really just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way, and you are free to create other folders that work in a similar manner.
	1.	To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
	2.	To create your own template sheets, simply create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (whether by adding text, changing the title, setting default meta-data, or whatever). Now this document will be available as the basis of new documents from the New From Template menu. (You can add a custom icon to this if you so wish, too.)
	3.	To set things up so that when the special folder created in (1) is selected and you hit “Add”, a new document based on the one you set up in (2) is created, select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default New Subdocument Type and select the special template document you created.
	•	Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
	1.	Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
	2.	Move the “Chapter” folder to the Trash.
	3.	Create a new text document for each chapter.
	4.	In the “Separators” pane of the Compile sheet (under “All Options”), change the “Text separator” setting to “Page break”.
	5.	You can use the “Replacements” pane of Compile to replace or remove whatever scene separator you use when exporting or printing to different formats.
	6.	If your scene separators are centred (for instance if you are using “#” as the scene separator) and you want them to appear centred in the compiled document, too, choose the “Formatting” pane of Compile, click on “Options…” and tick “Preserve alignment” and “Centered text only”.
	•	Everything else: The above constitutes only the most common changes. You can completely change the output format by changing the various settings available under the “All Options” tab of Compile.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Standard Manuscript Format”; “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback Novel” format; and “iBooks E-book” shows the results when compiling to “E-book” format and opening the resulting EPUB file in iBooks on the iPad.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Title>12: Beverage Service</Title>
            <Text>I made sure to take the front of the drink cart this time.  I wanted to talk to Mr. Dearborn and Mrs. Hamilton in 18.
It was a weird experience, serving from the front of the cart for the second time.  I hadn’t been paying much attention the first time so I didn’t have the orders memorized, but some of them were … just there.  Like a half-remembered exchange of dialogue from a favorite movie or book.  You don’t quite have it until someone starts saying it, then the words line up and tumble out after each other.
I didn’t know how it would possibly help, but I paid complete attention this time through.  As I stepped from each row to the next I recited the orders from the previous row to solidify them in my memory.  Then I tried to dig up a memory of the orders of the next row.
I also tried to keep an ear out for what Terry’s passengers were ordering and how they were interacting.  That was harder to keep in my head at the same time, but I found the challenge invigorating.  I felt like a spy on a secret mission, gathering intelligence.
We finished with the Smoking section and I pulled the translucent curtains shut behind me.  A number of passengers had lit up as soon as they’d gotten their drinks, so the smoke was becoming palpable.  The air filters would catch up, but these first few minutes of beverage service were always like this.
I served 18A, B, and C, then turned to my left, holding out a drink napkin.
“What can I offer you this evening?”
The severe-looking redhead in the window seat, Ms. Keats, shot a glance at Mr. Dearborn.  He returned a slight shrug.  Mrs. Hamilton seemed to have missed the exchange, looking up at me and shaking her head.
“Can’t,” was all she said, a hand poking out from under her blankets to tap on her chest, indicating her heart.
“Can I at least offer you some more water?”  I pointed to the empty cup on the tray in front of her.
The elderly woman considered it, but then shook her head again.
“Thank you, though.”
“Of course.  And for you?”  I looked at Ms. Keats.  I had a flash and remembered that Terry had said her name was Jennifer.
“I’d kill for a beer,” she said with a voice that was huskier than I’d expected.  I couldn’t remember if she’d said anything the first time through.
I held up a silver can of beer, cheap of course, for her inspection.
“That’s it?”
“I’m afraid so, though I can also offer a limited selection of mixed drinks.”
“No, that will be fine.”
I peeled the tab off the can, dropping it with a clink into the small garbage can on the cart.  I filled a plastic cup, replacing the now-half-full can on the cart beside the rest.
She accepted the cup and took a sip.  Her eyes fluttered closed and she inhaled through her nose.  The beer wasn’t anything to write home about, so she must not have had one in a long time.
“And for you, sir?  We’re having a run on Bloody Marys, if you are so inclined?”
He considered it, glancing aside to Mrs. Hamilton, whose eyes were already closed, her head reclined against the seat.
“Sure.  A Bloody Mary sounds great.”
I started to mix it, talking as I worked.
“The mix is pretty mild.”  I held up a small red bottle.  “Care for an extra kick?”
He smiled and waved off the suggestion.
“I’m a lightweight, but thanks.”
I didn’t know what I was looking for, but I wasn’t ready to move to the next row quite yet.  Thinking fast, I held up the pitcher of ice water to the man.  I didn’t say anything but pointed at the empty cup in front of Mrs. Hamilton and cocked my head at him, questioning.
Again he considered it before answering.
“You know what, Lily?  I could use some water to go with this.  May I?”
“Of course, sir.”
I grabbed another cup and poured out a serving.  He accepted it, replaced the cup on Mrs. Hamilton’s tray, and gave me the empty with a “we’ll see” shrug and a spoken “thanks”.
I leaned down to whisper to him.
“We’re going to have some turbulence later.  Could you make sure she’s buckled in before she falls asleep?”
Mr. Dearborn gave a vigorous nod.  I found myself out of stalling tactics, so I smiled and stepped forward to 19.</Text>

            <Title>9: Authoritative</Title>
            <Text>“It’s a textbook.”  I flipped it up so she could read the title.  “I’m going to night school.”
“Really?”  Her expression was intrigued, but otherwise unreadable.  “How many classes do you have left?”
I almost blurted out the same flip reply I always do when a crew mate noticed my school books—a self-deprecating deflection to switch over to some other topic.  Something about her body language made me bite it back. She settled back into the seat, crossing one leg over the other and looking the both relaxed and alert at the same time.  She was settling in.  She genuinely wanted to know.
“I’m a junior.  I’m just wrapping up a course in two weeks, but then I have 6 more semesters to go.”
“So … two more years?”
Her expression was still off-putting.  Not because there was anything wrong with it—there was not—but because I couldn’t parse it.  I found myself holding my breath, waiting for the other conversational shoe to drop.
“Class of ’78 if I can stick with it.”
Part of what was throwing me off was her attention.  She wasn’t distracted or disinterested, but she managed to keep an eye on Coach nonetheless.
“Would you go on, or would that be it?”
I exhaled through my nose, jaw line tighter than I would have liked.
“I don’t have much of a choice.  I’d never be able to afford it.”  I stared at the cover of the book in my lap, twisting visions of life choices, careers, and outcomes swirling through my mind’s eye.  “To be honest, the past six months of trying to juggle this job and school have been tough enough.  I can stick it out for two more years, but another four or more on top of that at this pace?  No way.”
There was a longer pause in which I didn’t get the sense that the conversation was over.  I was nice, actually.  It gave me a chance to get used to the idea of talking to her.  Socially, that is.  I didn’t hate the idea, I just hadn’t thought it would ever happen.
I was half-way through the sentence before I realized I was asking it.
“Did you get a degree?  Before you started doing this, I mean?”
As she spoke again she turned to face me.
“I went to college for a time, but it didn’t work out.”
“What was your major?”
It happened: she cracked.  By which I mean that the permanent plastic smile of hers dropped to a straight line, just for an instant.  Part of me was shocked, but another part just wanted to apologize and run away for causing such a thing to happen.  But there was no turning back—I was committed.
It was her turn to inhale before she answered.
“Accounting.  I was going to be an accountant.”
The words didn’t escape my lips, but they must have shone in my eyes.  Pamela regained her smile and then some.
“Not what you expected to hear?”
“No, but I’m not sure what I expected.”
“Why is that?”  She switched to a deep southern accent, straightening her back and posing her hands across her knee.  “You were expecting a hairdresser or cosmetologist?”
If possible, my eyes went even wider.  I felt my face flush.
“What?  No!  It’s just that you’re so …”
She dropped her hands back into her lap and leaned back to await my next word.  I groped around the inside of my brain, but I couldn’t come up with the right word.
“Authoritative.”
She looked stunned for a moment before throwing her head back and letting out a short, quiet gasp of a single laugh.
“I am certain I have never heard anyone say I was authoritative.”
She didn’t seem offended, so I continued.
“Maybe that’s not exactly the right word.  But you’re so confident.  Had you said fire chief or news anchor I would have been less surprised.”
“Why thank you, that’s very kind,” she said, jumping over that last sentence with the fluid motion of a ballerina.  “I was always good with numbers in high school.  Not the graphs and angles and geometry, but the hard numbers.”
“I took a statistics course last year.  I didn’t hate it, but it didn’t blow my skirt up.”
Her smile deepened.
“Probabilities and possibilities.  I loved my statistics classes.”  Her eyes jumped to Coach and back.  She ducked her head, conspiratorial.  “It’s what I do to entertain myself on long flights.”
“Statistics?  No way.”
That same gasp of a laugh escaped her.
“Everything is statistics.  When I have down time, I look out to see all those faces.  I think about this group compared to the group on my last flight.  It becomes a sort of a guessing game.  How many women will sit in First Class on my next flight?  How many old or young people?  Does the spread change more based on our city of departure or our city of arrival?  Is it changing over time?”
I was stunned.  I didn’t, in any way, think Pageant Pamela was dumb, but I never would have guessed that she played statistics games in her head to keep herself amused.
“That’s … that’s really cool,” was all I could get out.  Then it hit me.
“Hey!  I did that!”
“What’s that?”
“When we were preparing the cart earlier, I was thinking about how much alcohol we’d need versus how much we normally need.  I was doing my best to predict tequila versus rum, but then Terry threw it off by selling so many Bloody Marys that I had to run back for more vodka.”
“Oh, that’s good.”  Her lips pursed into a brief mock pout.  “I’m sad I didn’t get to play that one.”
Just like that, I had forgotten my tension and awkwardness around Pamela.
“How did you come to this,” I waggled my hand between us, indicating our uniforms, “instead of accounting?”
She took a moment to compose her answer.  The intensity of her smile faded a little, but didn’t vanish this time.
“Accountants use math to help people.  I’d get to make sure people didn’t misplace a decimal on their taxes.  If they were going through a hard time, I could help them or their business figure out what they needed to do to get back on track.  I’d get to make a difference.”
“I … I know exactly what you mean.”  I held up the textbook and she tipped her head to acknowledge it.
“But I had an … interruption in my time at college.  You can’t be an accountant without a degree and I couldn’t make a college schedule work out.  I didn’t want to live with my parents for the rest of my life, so one day I answered an ad in the paper.  It was on a whim, really.  I started out in this tiny airline you’ve never heard of, doing three quick turns a day so I could be home in time for dinner.  Along the way I realized that I got what I wanted.”
“How’s that?”
“I talk to fifty or sixty people each day.  It’s my job to make their lives better, if only for a short time.  Not all of them appreciate it, and some don’t even notice me.  But at the end of the day I know I’ve done my best and at least a few people are going to deplane a little happier than when they boarded.”
“Seriously?”
My incredulity broke the spell and she stared at me.
“No!  I mean, I’m just impressed that you can keep that attitude.”  I fanned my fingers toward the bulkhead between us and Coach.  “Must of them aren’t inclined to cheer.”
“It wouldn’t be much of a challenge if they were.”
We shared a silence that let me absorb what she’d said.  I broke it, thinking aloud.
“I never asked her why.”
The sound of my own voice snapped me out of it.  Pamela was looking at me, politely waiting for me to continue.
“My grandmother was a stewardess for twenty years.  She told me so many stories about it.  She got into it during World War II.  My grandfather was a gunner on a destroyer, and grandma said the only way she could keep up with that much adventure was to get a job where she was flying every day.  I think she would have been a pilot instead of a stewardess if she could have gotten away with it, just to one-up him.”
“She sounds like quite the firecracker.”
“Yeah.  I’ve seen old photos of her back then.  She flew everywhere while grandpa was at sea, always getting her photo taken at one landmark or another.  She had to prove that she’d been there and done that.”
“I know she switched to a regional airline when grandpa came back, then took a few years off when my mom was born.  But she went back to it for more than another decade, and I never asked her why.  What did she love about it so much that she would fly the same three flights to the same three cities, six hours a day every day?  I should have asked.”
The plane trembled, followed by a ding! a few seconds later.  We both turned to look at the indicator lights in the galley.  A Fasten Seat Belts icon now glowed a pale yellow-brown.
I turned to her and asked, “I can check Smoking?”  We needed to ensure passengers were belted-in, even if we had to wake them up to do it.  She knew what I meant and nodded.  I flashed to my dream version of this moment.  In it, Terry had checked both sections, telling me he wanted to stretch his legs.
The floor vibrated again, still only a warning of what was ahead.  I should have done this check before we hit the weather—if I have to wake anyone just to get them buckled, I’m going to feel awful.
We did our slow reconnaissance.  Of the sixty-six passengers in the Smoking section, all but two were secured.  I had to wake the mother in 14E to buckle her ten-year-old boy sleeping in 14F.  She didn’t take much, just a gentle hand on her shoulder.  I pointed to her son and whispered “seat belt” as the plane shook beneath us.
The second was a large man in 17D, snoring in hitches as I approached.  He didn’t wake up when I put my hand on his shoulder.  I didn’t want to shake him or speak too loudly, so I squatted down next to his seat to get closer to his ear.
“Sir?  Sir?  I need you to buckle up, sir.”
He stirred, but didn’t wake.  I considered taking the liberty of just buckling him in, but it looked like he was sitting on the far side of the belt.  Instead, I reached down to grasp his fingers and squeezed.
“Sir?”
He started awake with a snort, looking about before finding me crouched next to him.
“I need you to buckle up, sir.  We’re heading into some weather.”
The man scowled at me.  He started to speak, but I interrupted him.
“It will be light enough that you’ll be right back to sleep, but—” as if on cue the plane shimmied.  “But I need you safe and secure, sir.”
The man considered arguing with me but a second shake, forceful enough to make me grab the seat in front of him to steady myself, seemed to convince him.  I said a silent prayer of thanks for the good timing.
He fumbled around between himself and the seat as I stood up next to him.  I’ve seen enough play acting to know to not walk away until I saw him buckled, so I just beamed him my warmed smile.  He managed to extract the belt after some time, buckled, and made a show of closing his eyes and ignoring me.
“Thank you sir.  Sleep well.”
No one was likely to light up a cigarette any time soon, and even if they did it was unlikely to disturb anyone in Non-Smoking.  I decided to retract the curtains dividing the sections, pushing them into their recession in the bulkhead between 17 and 18.  This would make it easier for us to keep an eye on both sections for the remainder of the night.  I could come back in a few hours and close them again.
Pamela stood with her back to me just on the other side of the divider, whispering with the man in 18D.  She took a small step aft to clear the curtain, but didn’t turn around.  It gave me a thought, and I turned to walk back through my rows, counting.
According to my tally, four of the passengers in this section were still awake.  Each of them had their reading lights on, three engrossed in books and one middle-aged woman doing needlepoint.  I stepped around Pamela, still whispering with the man, and continued my count through Non-Smoking.  Other than the man in 18D, only two others were awake: Mr. Duchesne in 21C had an ancient-looking paperback, while a businesswoman in the far back corner of 27A had a briefcase on her lap and a pile of folders and papers she was flipping through.
The tremors beneath us were still not too violent, but had gotten persistent enough that I knew we should be getting to our seats, too.
I turned back to find Pamela walking toward me.  It took me a moment to place what was wrong: she wasn’t smiling.
Raising an eyebrow at her as she approached, I asked “everything okay?” in a whisper.
She raised her chin to point at our jump seats and walked past me.  I followed and we strapped ourselves in.
“What’s the matter?”
I was in the seat closest to the door, her the aisle, and she stared forward into Coach for several seconds before answering.
“I am not sure.  Something wasn’t right.”
“In 18?”
“Do you know their names?”
I almost answered before I caught myself.  I knew the names Terry had said in my dream: Dearborn, Hamilton, and Keats.  Those might have been their real names, which I had maybe seen on their tickets or luggage or the manifest.  But I couldn’t be sure, so I shook my head.
“Have you spoken with them tonight?”
“Yeah.  The older woman was having heart problems and I helped get her medication from the overhead.  Is she okay?”
Pamela was silent.  A flutter went through my chest that had nothing to do with the turbulence.
“Is she okay?”  I repeated.
“I don’t … I don’t know.”
It was the first time I had ever seen Pamela unsure of anything.  It made my blood run cold.
“What happened?”
“She wasn’t belted in, the older lady.”  Pamela’s hand reached out in front of her.  “I went to wake her, but the man caught my hand.”  She pulled it back in the same slow, distracted motion that had moved it forward.  “He asked that I not disturb her.  He said she’s a light sleeper, and that’s when I noticed that she was … moaning in her sleep.  Whimpering, like she was in pain.”
“That’s awful!  We should—”  I moved to unbuckle but Pamela stopped me.  The airplane continued to shake around us.
“He buckled her in.  The straps were right there on her lap.  He said she had finally gotten to sleep after a hard night.  That he appreciated if we could just let her rest.  But the sounds she was making … the tiniest things that I never would have noticed if I hadn’t been right there.”
“Do you,” I had trouble finishing.  “Do you think she’s okay?”
Pamela’s face tightened into a frown severe enough to turn the skin around her lipstick bright white.
“My father had a heart attack a few years ago.”  She looked down into her hands, now clasped in her lap.  “When I saw him in the hospital the next day he was asleep.  He made the same sounds.”
She grabbed for my hand and squeezed.  She took a deep breath, the next words tumbling out stilted and fractured.
“He died the next day.”</Text>

            <Title>13: Manifest</Title>
            <Text>We were back in the galley unloading the cart by 10pm according to the departure clock.  I wanted some time to myself to think.
“Terry, I can get this.  We’ve got forty-five minutes until the weather hits.  Why don’t you take a load off?”
He cocked his head but then shrugged.  “Right-o.”  His gaze went to the magazine rack on the bulkhead by the galley.  “I’ll be right back.”
In the past six months I’d unloaded carts like this more times than I could count, and could probably do it blindfolded.  The rote physical task was comforting, so my thoughts turned to my situation.
You’re looping.  Or you’re loopy.
Crazy would feel different, wouldn’t it?  I was beginning to wonder if I was crazy during the first repeat.  This one made it clear I wasn’t.
It was a loop.
I didn’t know how it started or why or who did it or what was causing it or even when it was going to happen again.  All I knew is that it was real.
Wait, I knew more than that, right?
I knew when and where the beginning of the loop was: standing in the Coach galley where I was now but at 9:17pm Pacific.
I also knew when and where I’d ended each of the previous loops.  The first one ended around 6:45am Eastern, or six and a half hours later.  The second one ended some time before 4:30am Eastern, or four hours and some change later.
Both times, I had found myself on the floor, staring out that unbelievable hole in the side of the aircraft.
And the numbness and pounding.
Right.  Both times, I went numb in my hands, arms, feet, and eventually legs.  My head had been thumping like a bass drum, louder and harder than anything I’d ever experienced.
Both times, I restarted the loop by falling on my ass and making a mess.
But your arm was fixed.
That’s right!  It had broken the first time through.  As unbelievable as it sounds, I had forgotten about it.  When I restarted it was back to normal.
Terry walked back to the jump seats and sat down, waving a newspaper as he passed.
In fact … the only physical difference upon restart seemed to be my appetite.  Each time I looped I felt like I hadn’t eaten in days, even though I know I’d eaten only a couple of hours before the … Wait, what do I call the time before my first restart?  The first time through.
I can’t call it “the first loop” or “loop one” because I wasn’t looping yet.  I’m going to have to take a page from my textbook and call it “loop zero”.
Got it.  Loop zero is the sequence of events that led to “restart one”, the jump back to “loop one”.  I just had restart two, and am now in loop two, which is the third time through.  I can handle that.  But it’s a new perspective on how easy it is to make off-by-one errors in loops—I never thought I’d be living a loop from the inside.
I have to assume it could happen again.  I need to be more observant this time.  It’s the only way I’ll be able to figure out what’s causing it.
Then there’s the explosion.
That, too.  I need to figure out where it’s coming from.  It would be pretty dumb to figure out how to stop the loop, only to drop like a rock into the Gulf of Mexico.
I turned to port and tried to absorb every detail in front of me.
From rearward-left to forward-right I saw the lavatories, our jump seats, the rear exit, goods storage for the galley, a coat closet, and row 27 with its three seats.
I’d been in one of the lavatories on loop two, and had been safe.  I also knew the jump seats were safe as they hadn’t been affected.
On the zero loop I hadn’t been able to see the exit, which implied that it wasn’t the problem.  It had been intact at the end of the first loop, as well.
The first explosion had been chaotic enough that I couldn’t remember how far back the hole had extended.  Had it eaten the galley storage, or just the coat closet?  The gaping hole had been distracting enough—I had been too out of it to pay attention to details.
The second explosion had disintegrated the coat closet and half of the storage closet.  I stared at them, tracing their edges and building a mental model of the space.
My eyes closed and I tried to overlay what I had seen only a short while ago.
The galley storage wall was, in effect, just a large frame into which plugged a number of crates, carts, and small shelf compartments.  We used it to store meals, dishes, drinks, and everything else we’d need throughout the flight.  The wall faced the lavatories, running from the door to the aisle.
Around the corner, there was a closet that opened onto the aisle itself.  This meant the port side compartments, closer to the door, were deeper than the aisle-side, as the shallow closet took up some of that space.
Still with my eyes closed, I rummaged through my memories of what was behind the doors.
The storage closet held the air bottles and masks I had been trying to get, as well as a small stack of spare life vests.  It was also where we kept our cleaning supplies for big messes: disinfectant, sponges, plastic bags, rubber gloves, and probably a few other things I couldn’t remember right now.
The coat closet, as I’d verified earlier, contained nothing but coats.  I’d double-check it later after lights-out.
Row 27 backed up to the forward wall of the coat closet.  In it currently sat three passengers.  The businesswoman with the coat was in 27A by the window.  Two men, who I assumed were father and son, sat in 27B and 27C.
I opened my eyes and reconciled my mental model with what was in front of me.
You’re missing a piece—there’s a hole.
The coat closet was maybe three feet deep as measured from the aisle to windows, then maybe two feet wide as measured perpendicular to that, from the lavatories toward row 27.  The galley storage wall was maybe two feet deep, but it sat aft of the coat closet, sharing a wall.
That meant there was a chunk of space, maybe three feet by two, wedged in between the coat closet, row 27, and the galley storage.
It was likely filled with machine equipment—maybe the air circulation system, the compressors for the refrigerated compartments in the galley storage, or similar.
This cast a dark shadow over my bomb theory.  If some piece of equipment in that space was faulty it could have been the cause of the explosion and decompression.  If something I had done differently between loops one and two had caused that equipment to cycle earlier, switch on or off earlier, or just anything different … then there was no way to know.
So you’re back to square one.
I looked down to see that the card was empty, the dishes and pitchers stowed.  I wheeled the cart into its storage space and flipped down the oversized locking handle that would keep it in place.
Terry noticed the motion, folded his newspaper backwards to mark his place, and tucked it away into his jump seat as he flipped it up and locked it.  He glanced at that oversized watch and nodded.
“Lights out?”
I opened a door and pulled out a plastic garbage bag that already had a few items in it.
“I’ll walk if you’ll talk,” I said, pointing to the PA mic.
“I don’t mind walking.”
“I’ve got it, thanks.  I need to get the blood flowing before I am stuck in that seat for two hours of weather.”
Terry shrugged and reached for the PA, proceeding to give a by-the-numbers announcement about lights-out, upcoming weather, lavatories, and service items.
One of the first things we learn as flight attendants is that passengers don’t like it when you approach them from the rear of the plane.  They feel like you’re sneaking up on them.  I brisk-walked to the curtain between rows 6 and 7, the border between First Class and Coach, before turning and beginning a slow walk back to the rear.
Mr. Duchesne waved as I passed.  He and a two other passengers stood and made their ways to the lavatories, heeding Terry’s warning about lights-out and the weather.
My goal was to see how much more I could observe about the passengers, but I still had to do my job and make sure they were secured.  This meant I was picking up trash, ahem, service items, and ensuring passengers were buckled.  The same walk-through happened some twenty minutes later on the previous loop.  This time I was able to catch people before they fell asleep, including the mother in 14E.
As I worked my way back through Smoking, Jennifer Keats stepped into the section and lit up a cigarette faster than the curtains could close behind her.  She smiled at me, looked at the cigarette, and shrugged in a “what are you going to do?” kind of way.  She moved to let me pass as I approached, but I stopped at 17 to tell the man to buckle.  As the large man struggled to extract his safety belt I addressed Jennifer in something just above a whisper.
“How’s Mrs. Hamilton?”
She took a drag and blew a line of smoke toward the ceiling before answering.
“We’ll see.  She’s sleeping now,” she said, frowning and taking another drag.
Despite the slow pace of the conversation, the man was still struggling with his belt, scowling at us both for standing right next to him.
“Heart problems?  Will she need more medication before we land?”
Jennifer’s frown deepened and she repeated her smoke-before-answering trick.
“Ah, right, that was you.”  She turned to look at the man in 17C, found him asleep, opened the ashtray in his armrest, and flicked off her accumulated ash.  “Thank you for your help earlier,” she said before turning back to me.  “That’s all she’ll need for the flight.”
The man stopped fidgeting.  I looked and confirmed that he was buckled in.
“Can I get either of you anything else for the night?”
The man snorted, took off his glasses, and closed his eyes.  “Go chat in the back,” he said.
I looked to Jennifer, who was now half-way through her cigarette.  She squinted at the man and shook her head.
“I’m fine, thank you,” she said, turning to stub out her cigarette and drop it into the ash tray, flicking the lid closed.
We stepped through the curtain.  Mr. Dearborn had his tray down and had collected both empty drink cups and wadded napkins.  I opened the garbage bag and he tossed them in.  He flipped the tray up but then didn’t stand to let her in, instead pulling back his legs and holding his magazine to his chest.  Jennifer didn’t seem to care and stepped gingerly past him and the sleeping Mrs. Hamilton.  She brushed against the blankets as she passed, revealing Mrs. Hamilton’s side and an unbuckled belt.
Jennifer lowered herself to her seat and buckled.  I caught her attention along with Mr. Dearborn.
“Can you two get her buckled in, please?” I asked, again just above a whisper.
Jennifer moved to pull her side of the belt out from under the blankets, but Mr. Dearborn looked confused for a moment before joining her.  They got the older woman buckled, and Mr. Dearborn adjusted her blankets to ensure coverage.  She stirred once due to the activity, but never woke up.
“Thanks,” I said.
Jennifer smiled and turned off her reading light.  Mr. Dearborn nodded and went back to reading his magazine.
Mr. Duchesne was returning to his seat as I turned back down the aisle.
“Can I get you anything else tonight, Mr. Duchesne?  Jim?”
He looked pale, even for a man of what I guessed to be late seventies.  I gave it even odds that he’d been born before the turn of the century.  I realized that this man had seen the birth of aviation and had been alive for decades before the job of Flight Attendant, at that time Stewardess, had even existed.
“Do you know how bad the weather will be?”
His knuckles trembled with the strength of his grip on his armrests.  I flashed to our first encounter with him pulling drinks off the cart—he’d been hoping to take the edge off.  Before I realized what I was doing, I was squatted next to him and had one hand covering his.  He tensed and then relaxed.
“It’s not going to be bad at all,” I soothed.  “I can personally promise that we won’t get anything more serious than a few bumpy minutes at a time.  It’ll last a little more than two hours, but it will be smooth flying from there.”
He looked like he was going to say something but then just nodded.
“Try and get some sleep for me, Jim.  It’ll help.”
He gave me weak smile and slid down in his seat, closing his eyes.  I stood and continued my sweep.
I got back to the galley to see that fifteen minutes had passed.  I dimmed the cabin lights with the rheostat on the galley control panel.
Terry was back to his paper, putting it down into his lap as I approached.
“Everything all right?” he asked.
“It looks like it.  Do you mind if I sit up front for the weather?”
“I don’t mind at all.  I’ll call if I need anything.”
“Thanks.  See you in a few hours.”
First Class was already dimmed as I passed through it.  I found Pamela in her jump seat, reading.
“Knock, knock,” I said as I approached.
It was disconcerting for a moment to see how she looked at me: with her mask on.  She smiled, but it was a different smile than I had been expecting.  We’d gotten to know each other in the previous loop and she’d opened up, but in this loop I was back to being someone she didn’t know.
“Do you mind some company for the weather?”
This was technically a no-no.  If anything were to happen, such as weather nastier than expected, I was supposed to be in the back to help out with Coach.  But even though this version of Pamela didn’t remember the last two times she’d been through this weather, she still knew it wasn’t supposed to be a big deal.
She made a sweeping motion with her hand as if to say “my house is your house” and went back to her book.
“I was also going to make some hot tea.  Should I make two?”
Pamela closed her book around a finger to keep her place and considered.
“That would be very nice, thank you.”</Text>

            <Title>14: Before Weather</Title>
            <Text>I kept my purse in a small storage compartment in the First Class galley.  On most flights I didn’t have any use for it, and First Class was more secure than a similar compartment in Coach as there was far less traffic.  While waiting for the tea to steep I grabbed my school notebook and a pen from my bag.  Also useless on most flights as I wouldn’t have the time to study my notes, they were my constant companions on overnight flights.
I put them down on my jump seat, telling Pamela as I passed that I would be right back.
The door to the cockpit was a few steps past the forward lavatory.  The door had a knob with a lock, but it was kept unlocked on most flights.  I knocked and let myself in.  Both men turned to look at me.
“Captain.  Captain.”  I nodded to each of them.
Simon, sitting on the starboard side, spoke while Lawrence returned to scanning his instruments.
“Is everything okay, Lily?”
The head attendant, more often than not the one running First Class, was considered the interface to the cockpit.  It was understandable that their first question would be if everything was all right.
“Yes, though I was hoping we could borrow the passenger manifest for a few minutes.  We have a passenger with a heart condition who is having a bad night.  I thought it might be good to know who the doctors are before we get into the weather, just in case.”
“Good thinking.  Of course.”  Simon picked up a folder sitting between the two of them, flipped through several loose sheets of paper in a pocket, and handed it to me.
“Thanks.  I’ve got a pot of English Breakfast going.  Can I bring either of you a mug?”
Simon pointed to a tall white mug in a holder next to him.
“Pamela has us on a coffee IV drip, but thank you.”
“I’ll be right back with this,” I said, and let myself out.
Pamela watched me as I passed her a second time.  I poured us both mugs of tea, returning to the jump seats.
“Is that the manifest?”
“Yeah.  Did Terry talk to you about Mrs. Hamilton?”
“I don’t believe so.”  She slipped a beverage napkin into her book where her finger had been holding her place.  “What’s wrong?”
I told her about my original encounter with row 18, trying to use some of the words she had used to describe Mrs. Hamilton in the previous loop.  Her sharp inhalation at “weak heart” let me know that I’d managed to work my way past her mask.
I skimmed a finger down the manifest, holding it between us.
“It looks like we have three doctors on board.  Dr. Henry Forrest in 3C and what could be a husband and wife in 24E and 24F, Drs. Alan and Edna Michelson.”
Pamela’s tone was dry.  “Dr. Forrest had three martinis and is now fast asleep.  Do you remember the Michelsons?”
I closed my eyes and mentally walked back through beverage service, counting three rows forward from the galley.
“I … think so.  If they are who I think they are, he had a gin and tonic and she declined a drink.”  I opened my eyes.  “I don’t think we’ll need them, but it’s good to know where they are.”  Tea mug still in hand but half-forgotten and cooling, I stood up with the list in my other hand.  “I’ll get this back to the captains.”  I put the mug on my seat and walked slowly back to the cockpit.
I perused the list, picking out two specific names: Ernest Dearborn and Mary Hamilton.  Ernest, Mary, Jennifer.
After returning the paper to Simon, I tried my best to be nonchalant about returning to my seat and picking up my notebook.  I wrote down all of the names and seat assignments I could remember.  I knew they wouldn’t transfer into the next loop—nothing else had so far—but I hoped the act of writing them down would help me remember them.
The first tentative rumbles of weather started a few minutes later, followed by the ding! and the Fasten Seat Belts sign.  I looked into the galley at the two clocks: the left clock read 10:44 while it was 1:44 according to the one on the right.  I inscribed this time into my notebook, then flipped it closed before standing.
“I can do it,” I said as Pamela started to get up.  “I wanted to stretch my legs anyway.”
She looked at me with an opaque expression, shrugged, and said “thanks” before returning to her book.
I put my notebook back into my purse in its compartment and started the rounds to check that passengers were secured.</Text>

U.S. aviation security timeline
June 12, 2011|By Jane Engle | Los Angeles Times Staff Writer
Here are some significant events and policies in the history of U.S. aviation security:

1955

A United Airlines plane explodes after takeoff in Denver, killing all 44 aboard. Investigators blame Jack Graham for placing a bomb in his mother's luggage, apparently in hopes of cashing in on her life insurance. It is among the first major acts of criminal violence against a U.S. airliner. Graham is later convicted of murder and executed.

1960

A National Airlines plane explodes in midair, killing all 34 aboard. Investigators suspect that a passenger, bent on suicide, had brought a bomb aboard.

1961

Antulio Ramirez Ortiz hijacks a National Airlines flight to Cuba after it takes off in Florida. It is the first aerial hijacking of a U.S. passenger plane.



The U.S. government begins placing armed guards on commercial planes when requested by airlines or the FBI.

1969

Numerous airliners are hijacked to Cuba. Two Palestinian terrorists carry out the first hijacking of a U.S. aircraft outside the Western Hemisphere when they divert TWA Flight 840 to Damascus, Syria, after takeoff from Rome.

The Federal Aviation Administration develops a hijacker psychological profile to be used along with metal detectors to screen passengers and their bags. Eastern Air Lines begins using this system, and several airlines follow.

1970

Arab terrorists hijack four airliners, including Pan American World Airways and TWA jets, and blow them up on the ground in the Mideast after releasing all aboard.

The Customs Air Security Officers Program ("Sky Marshals") is created to place armed officers, dressed as passengers, on aircraft.

1971

Claiming to have a bomb, a man traveling as D.B. Cooper hijacks a flight in Portland, Ore., as it prepares for takeoff. After arriving in Seattle, he collects $200,000 in ransom and frees the passengers. He boards the plane, forces the crew to take off and parachutes away. He is never found.

The FAA reports that screening of passengers had produced 1,500 arrests and the recovery of a horde of weapons.

1972

After a TWA flight takes off from New York's JFK airport, the airline is notified that a bomb is onboard. The plane returns to the airport, where a bomb-sniffing dog finds the device minutes before it is set to detonate.

Numerous violent hijackings occur in the U.S.

The FAA creates the Explosives Detection Canine Team Program.

The FAA in December issues an emergency rule requiring all passengers and carry-on baggage to be either screened by metal detectors or searched by hand and requiring airports to station armed guards at boarding checkpoints.

1973

Five Palestinian terrorists open fire at a Rome airport and hurl fire bombs into a Pan Am jet, killing 30 people. They commandeer a Lufthansa jet and fly to Athens; a hostage is killed.

1974

Two people are killed and dozens injured when a bomb explodes near the Pan Am ticket counter at LAX.

The 1974 Air Transportation Security Act sanctions the FAA's universal screening rule, which spurs U.S. airports to adopt metal-detection screening portals for passengers and X-ray inspection systems for carry-on bags.

1985

Lebanese terrorists divert TWA Flight 847 en route from Athens to Rome; one hostage, a U.S. Navy diver, is killed in the 17-day ordeal.



Federal Air Marshals, successors to the Sky Marshals, become a permanent part of the FAA workforce on international flights.

1988

A bomb concealed in a radio-cassette player destroys Pan Am Flight 103, flying from London to New York, over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.

U.S. carriers at European and Mideast airports begin to require X-rays or searches of all checked baggage and to match passengers and their baggage.

1995

A plot by Muslim terrorists to blow up 11 U.S. jumbo jets over the Pacific in a single day is uncovered in the Philippines.

1996

TWA Flight 800 explodes after takeoff from New York and crashes into the Atlantic, killing all 230 people aboard. Initially believed to be terrorist-related, the crash is later blamed on equipment failure.

1997

A sky marshal (also known as air marshal or flight marshal) is an undercover law enforcement or counter terrorist agent on board a commercial aircraft to counter aircraft hijackings. Sky marshals may be provided by airlines such as El Al (who provide sky marshals on every flight), or by government agencies such as the Austrian Einsatzkommando Cobra, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, German Federal Police, National Security Guard in India, Metropolitan Police SO18 (Aviation Security Operational Command Unit) or US Federal Air Marshal Service.

In response to the September 11 incidents, the Commonwealth instituted an Air Security Officer (ASO) Program under the Australian Federal Police in December 2001.[1][2] These officers are generally referred to in the media as Sky Marshals.[3] The ASO Programme provides a discreet anti-hijacking capability for Australian civil aviation by providing armed security personnel on board aircraft.[2] This involves both random and intelligence-led placement of armed ASOs on flights operated by Australian registered air carriers, on both domestic and international flights.

Officers are armed and trained and equipped for a variety of situations on both domestic and international flights.[4][5]

In Austria, armed air marshals are provided since 1981 by the Einsatzkommando Cobra.

The Canadian Air Carrier Protection/Protective Program (CACPP) began on September 17, 2002 when a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with Transport Canada, the authority responsible for Canadian aviation security, and the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA), for the implementation and administration of the CACPP. The program is conducted by specially trained undercover, armed RCMP officers (known as Aircraft Protective Officers- APOs) on selected domestic and international flights and all flights to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Pilots and flight attendants are advised of their presence and the officer will physically intervene should an unauthorized person attempt to gain control of an aircraft.[6] APOs, however, will not be involved in controlling unruly passengers.[7] While they are peace officers within Canadian territories, they rely on section 6(2) of the Tokyo Convention as a legal basis for intervening an incident outside of Canadian airspace.[7] By law, such officers are exempt from acquiring a permit for importing or exporting their duty firearms when crossing the border.[8] However, the exact nature of their weaponry is not released to the public except they are "deadly and effective and should not damage the aircraft." [9] The Canadian Forces Military Police members of the Canadian Forces Air Marshal Detail, are responsible for providing security to Canadian Forces aircraft, crew and passengers – passengers who may include the Governor General, the Prime Minister and members of the Royal Family.[10]

Months after the September 11 attacks, private operators like Jet Airways and Air Sahara introduced sky marshals in some of their flights and had plans to increase it.[needs update] Indian Airlines had previously started this in December 1999 after the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814.[11]

In 2003, Air India had an agreement with a US directive to have air marshals on all of its US-bound flights. They are recruited from India's elite commando force National Security Guard.[12]

Ireland does not have a dedicated sky marshal agency, although there is a National Civil Aviation Security Committee (NCASC). Limited capabilities are provided by the Garda Síochána Emergency Response Unit (ERU), the national police armed tactical unit, and backup may be provided by the counter-terrorism Garda Special Detective Unit (SDU) and the Army Ranger Wing (ARW) special forces unit in certain situations.[13][14]

The Irish government allows armed flight marshals from the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Israel, Australia and specific European Union (EU) countries onboard international flights landing from or destined for those countries in Irish airspace, once they are informed of their presence beforehand. Weapons carried by an air marshal in Ireland include a concealed handgun, taser, knife and pepper spray.[15]

Singapore Airlines and Silkair deploys sky marshals in their flights. Such members are armed with firearms loaded with special ammunition and dart-firing stun gun.

Members are usually from either the Air Marshal Unit, the Security Command or the Special Tactics and Rescue (STAR) of the Singapore Police Force. Members have undergone extensive training to enable them to operate effectively within the confines of an aircraft.

Sky Marshals are rarely used on flights originating from the UK. Officers from The Metropolitan Police Service Aviation Security Operational Command Unit (SO18) are used on random flights, however details of the programme are not made public and the extent of their use is not widely known. For this reason their use is not heavily documented in the media.

Main article: Federal Air Marshal Service
The US Federal Aviation Administration began its "Sky Marshal" program in 1968, which eventually became the Federal Air Marshal Service in 1985. That year, an Egyptian security officer on board EgyptAir Flight 648 opened fire on three Abu Nidal Organization hijackers, killing one before being fatally shot himself. In 2005, Rigoberto Alpizar was shot dead by two sky marshals on a jetway at Miami International Airport. Currently, Federal Air Marshal Officers are under the Transportation Security Administration. Under the Visible Intermodal Prevention Response (VIPR) system, started up circa 2005, FAMs began to patrol non-aviation sites like bus terminals and train stations.[16]

On May 30, 2013, the first book ever written on the history of the air marshals was published in the United States by former air marshal Clay Biles. The book, titled The United States Federal Air Marshal Service: A Historical Perspective, 1962–2012 gave never-before-released information on the more than fifty years of Federal Air Marshal Service. The author interviewed a number of former Sky Marshals and contributed significantly to reversing the lack of information on this short-duration program.[17][18]

The air marshal played by Peter Sarsgaard is a central character in the suspense thriller Flightplan, starring Jodie Foster, Erika Christensen and Sean Bean.[19]
In the movie Non-Stop, the plot revolves around a US air marshal (Liam Neeson) who is accused of killing passengers while en route from New York to London.[20]

            <Title>18: Daybreak</Title>
            <Text>Terry brought the lights up on schedule while I started up both coffee machines.  Between the lights, activity, and caffeinated aroma, most passengers were already awake by the time Captain Lawrence got on the PA.
“Good morning everyone and welcome to Florida.  We hope you got some good sleep through last night’s weather—we did our best to keep it smooth.  We’re a half-hour out from Miami International, where the weather is clear and the locals think it’s cold at 72 degrees.”
That earned him sleepy chuckles which probably woke up a few more passengers.
“The high for today is 80 and we’re looking at beautiful sunny weather all day.  We’re going to start our descent in about fifteen minutes.”
The Coach galley arrival clock read 6:35.
I didn’t know the exact time of the first explosion, but I had the last two hours to think about it.
The guy in the business suit who had asked for a towel had done so as the line for the lavatories had gotten bad.  The line picked up when everyone had heard the announcement Lawrence had just given.  Sure enough, a half-dozen passengers had gotten up and started filing back towards me.
Instead of ferrying coffee and other beverages this time, I left that up to Terry.  I told him I’d make drinks for him while also keeping the lavatory line in order.  He’d looked dubious but hadn’t argued.
I wanted to be back in the galley when it happened.  It would give me the best view of events, which I hoped would lead to some sort of clue about what I was supposed to do next.
For every person who left the lavatories and squeezed their way out past the line, another person got out of their seat and kept the queue from shrinking.  Without realizing how much time had passed, I looked up to find the business-suited man in front of me.
“Excuse me, miss,” he said in a voice that went from normal volume to a whisper.  “Lily.  I was wondering if you could do me a favor.”  He stepped into the galley with me, a tight enough fit when I know the other person.
I knew what he wanted, but I had to let it play out.  It took an act of will to not look at the clocks to mark the time, which might have been misinterpreted by the man.
“How’s that, sir?”
“I wanted to wash my face, but I don’t want to take up a space in line from someone who really needs it.  Do you think I could get a towel from First Class?”
“I’m sorry, sir, but First Class isn’t offering towel service today.”
He looked surprised.
“Are you sure?”
“Yes, sir.”  I put my hand on his shoulder, turning us both back to the aisle.  “But the line is moving quick.  I think you’ll be okay to take a moment in the washroom.”
He looked like he wanted to say something, but thought better of it and squeezed his way out to then turn and step back into line.</Text>

            <Title>15: Data</Title>
            <Text>I know I’m grasping at straws, I do.
The knowledge I’m gathering—wait, knowledge is the wrong word.
The data I’m gathering may be useless.
Do I really need to know the exact time the weather starts?  Or that Pamela is a third of the way through The Moneychangers, Arthur Hailey’s latest novel about banking industry?
I don’t yet have a specific plan for the doctors.  I contrived the story to get the manifest so I could be sure of a few names, and Mary Hamilton’s heart condition seemed like a good enough excuse.
What am I supposed to be looking for?  This is my third time through and I am no closer to understanding what even causes the explosion, much less how I can prevent it.
As for why I’m looping … I have no clue at all.  In computer programming, all loops have some kind of exit condition—something that must be true for the loop to continue, or false to exit the loop.  I’m not any closer to figure out why I’m in the loop, so there’s no way I’ll be able to change whatever it is to get out.
For now, I don’t have too many options but to keep my eyes peeled.  I just need to absorb every detail I can.
The problem with this plan is how … nonlinear … it is.  It’s six or eight hours of routine and boredom followed by ninety seconds of terror.  Rinse, repeat.
If my college professors are to be believed, this is pretty much exactly what the rest of my professional life is going to be like.  Spend days writing code that might run for hours only to get a result that isn’t what you or your boss were hoping for.  Rinse, repeat.
I can’t believe I’m going to say this, but I hope I keep looping.  If the loop ends before I’ve figured out how to stop the explosion I’m as good as dead.
When people ask me why a flight attendant would want to become a programmer I always say it’s because I love solving little puzzles and logic problems.  Becoming a programmer was supposed to let me write code which would help people solve their own puzzles.
Now I have a 707-sized puzzle to unravel and 155 other people whose lives depend on my puzzle-solving abilities.

            <Title>16: After Weather</Title>
            <Text>The weather came and went, loud and angry but not violent.  I noted the time of the clocks when the ding! Sounded and the FSB light winked out: 12:55 and 3:55.
Pamela and I didn’t say much to each other this time through the storm.  I gave her more details about my interactions with Dearborn, Hamilton, and Keats, but as she hadn’t experienced it herself this time she was far less concerned.  She’d gone back to her book with a “there’s nothing we can do about it now, anyway” and the rest of the time passed in silence.
I also learned that she was a fast reader.  In the two hours we were next to each other she got through another third of her book, which looked to total on the near side of 500 pages.  If left to her own devices she would finish that book before she had to get up and start making the morning coffee.  Once again I had no idea how that could possibly be useful information.
Terry, I discovered, had given up on his newspaper and had his paperback instead.
That’s an interesting change.
He’d almost vivisected the newspaper in the last loop he’d spent up front.  This time the newspaper looked as if it had been skimmed, not read front to back.  In loop zero he’d read his paperback through the storm and most of the pre-dawn hours.  I hadn’t been paying enough attention to remember how far he’d gotten, but this looked similar enough to that loop.
Had his position within the airplane made that much of a difference in how he kept himself busy?  Or had I done or said something that led to that difference?
My eyes widened in sudden realization: I hadn’t seen Terry at the end of either loop.  A half-dozen scenarios flitted across my mind’s eye: Terry by the rear exit, unconscious from a head wound.  Terry, like me, caught unaware in a lavatory, but stuck behind a jammed door and banging to get free.  Terry passed out from lack of oxygen in one of the passenger rows because he’d been trying to get masks on everyone else.
And worst: Terry getting caught in the first explosion, blown out the gaping hole, and falling limp to the Earth below.
I replayed the aftermath of explosion two: had I seen Terry and Pamela come back through the curtains as she and I had done after the first?  No.  I’d been focused on the hole, but I think I would have noticed that.
Come to think of it, I hadn’t heard either of them over the PA.  The second explosion had only been followed by passengers screaming and the sucking roar of the wind—no commanding or comforting flight attendants to the rescue.  What had happened to Pamela and Terry at the end of that loop?
A low-grade headache set up shop just above the nape of my neck.  I’d had a headache both other times through, as well.  Well, that and the cranium-splitter that came on each time just before I looped.
That’s a good point.
It could be that my headache is linked to my looping, but right now it felt like a normal headache.  Well, like I said I rarely get headaches, but on the occasions when I had they weren’t too different.  I found the galley stash of aspirin and tossed back a pair of pills.
“Everything all right?” Terry asked from behind me.
“Just a small headache.  I’m going to grab some food from up front so the aspirin doesn’t tear up my stomach.  Want anything?”
“Nah.  I had my dinner during the storm.”
Huh.  I don’t remember that from loop zero.
“Be right back.”
Pamela was in the First Class galley, picking her way into a sandwich.  I caught her mid-bite so she gave me a half-wave for a greeting.
“I was just thinking the same thing,” I told her.
High Desert Air may be a bargain basement airline, but they try to do right by us.  Even on flights without meal service there is always something provided for the flight attendants.  Sandwiches were common, though we might get an upgrade if the catering service at the departure airport was that infrequent combination of both good and cheap.  Some of us will pack a lunch in case the offerings aren’t great, but most of us will eat almost anything that isn’t junk food.  I think I mentioned that flight attendants and free food go hand-in-hand, right?
The selection tonight was a turkey sandwich, a turkey sandwich, or if I wanted to go wild, a turkey sandwich.  As Thanksgiving was just over two weeks ago I shouldn’t be surprised.  It’s a safe assumption that any flights I pick up between now and New Years will probably have the exact same options.
I’m not complaining.  A free, decent sandwich is a free, decent sandwich.
There was also an extra salad container in the fridge, but a quick glance around the galley didn’t find a twin for it, meaning this salad was likely Pamela’s.
Sandwich obtained, I mirrored Pamela’s half-wave and walked back to the aft galley.  I thought back to what I remembered from the previous loop: there should be two men in Smoking who are awake, along with Mr. Duchesne and the businesswoman in 27A.  I saw that I was right, though I had forgotten the fine details.  One man was doing a crossword, the other reading, and Mr. Duchesne was returning to his seat from the lavatory.  The businesswoman looked up and smiled as I passed.
On a whim, I dropped off my sandwich on the galley counter and poked my head around the wall of the coat closet.  The woman caught the motion and looked up at me.
“Can I get you anything?”  As the father and son between us were sleeping, I said it just above a whisper, exaggerating the words with my mouth and pointing between myself and the galley.
The woman considered, then nodded.  She held up a finger, pointed to herself and then the aisle, making the scissor motion for walking.  I nodded and stepped back into the galley, throwing my sandwich into a cupboard to get it out of sight.  Most people on normal schedules wouldn’t think about eating at 4am, but you could never be too careful.
“Oh, that’s nice,” the woman said as she stepped toward me stretching.    Her Southern accent made it come out nahs.  “What time is it?”
This is a tricky question to answer.  We’re never sure if passengers want the departure time zone, arrival time zone, or in rare cases the time zone we were flying through at the time.  But given her accent, I assumed Eastern was how she thought of home.
“Just after four.”  The next question was obvious, even without the looping, so I answered it before she asked.  “It’s a bit less than three hours to go.”
“What time is our wake-up call?”
There was a piece of paper held to the galley bulkhead behind me that had our exact schedule, but I knew it by heart.
“We’ll turn up the lights two hours from now, around 6:15.  That will give everyone a chance,” I flicked my head toward the lavatories, “before we start our descent at a quarter to seven.”
“Oooo,” she crooned as she turned and walked aft, “I should beat the rush.  Pardon me a moment.”
She was dressed in a merlot silk blouse and black tuxedo pant combo that was nice enough to be a little out of place in the aft-end of Coach.  She had a light tan leather purse snugged up under her left shoulder that looked large enough to be uncomfortable.  Terry, still in the jump seat working on his paperback, exchanged hellos with her as she chose a lavatory.
I stepped out of the galley and snuck a glance at the briefcase now occupying her seat.  It was a deep cabernet leather, oversized even for a man, with polished brass accents and locks that looked as expensive as I’d expect from her outfit.  The woman couldn’t have been much more than 5’4”, so when she walked it probably looked like she was carrying a steamer trunk.
She looked to be in her late twenties, maybe a few years older than me.
Being a flight attendant does weird things to your head when it comes to how you think about other people.  On the one hand you see so many people every day, each with their own story, needs, and desires, that you can’t help but appreciate the sheer diversity of human existence.  On the other hand you also see just how easy it is for stereotypes to be true, so it gets hard to not put people into buckets.  Some of us, myself included, turn it into a kind of game, inventing back-stories for the passengers.
This woman didn’t fit into any of those nice, easy buckets.  Each thing about her was a contradiction.  She had an air of maturity and politeness that I associated with women a decade older.  Her briefcase was nice, but clearly meant for a man.  Her clothing was nice, but I thought back to that coat.  The bright avocado green would look awful with her dark red blouse, not to mention the incongruous briefcase.  And while it was rare but not exceptional that someone in Coach stayed awake through an overnighter, I can’t think of the last time it was because they were working.  That kind of thing was far more common in First Class.
I couldn’t figure out her story.
On another whim, I stepped across the aisle and pulled out a blanket from storage, putting it down on the counter next to me.
The woman stepped out of the lavatory and walked over to the exit door.
A passenger walking up to the exit door mid-flight is to a flight attendant what a suspect reaching into his jacket is to a cop.  Flight attendants and cops both know that the vast majority of people aren’t stupid enough to do anything unexpected, but that twist in the gut will always be there.
She didn’t do anything crazy, just put her hands to the sides of the small window and pressed her face to it.
“Huh.”  She said.  “Not much to see.”
“What’s keeping you up all night?”  I asked when she returned.
“I have a tight deadline for work.”
“Can I make you some coffee?”
The woman considered the question, then said “that would be nice, thank you.”
“It’ll just take a minute to brew,” I said as I turned into the galley and went fishing for the tin of coffee grounds. “What do you do, if I may ask?”
“I do research and legwork for contract negotiations.”
Impressed, I paused and blinked.  “That sounds intense.  What does it involve?”
“Too many late nights, I’m afraid.”  She chuckled, then continued.  “Let’s say you’re a company that wants to acquire something from another company.  It might be equipment or technology or even people.  You would hire me to look into the best way to go about it.  I would tell you to make an open cash offer, or to go through a third party, or maybe even to use the legal system.”
I punched the button to start the coffee machine and turned back to her.
“Like due diligence?”
The woman shrugged, noncommittal.
“I’m usually involved a step or two before official due diligence.  I make sure it’s worth going down that particular road at all.”
“Oh, so you don’t work for a law firm?”
“I’m an independent contractor.  It’s just me.”
“How do you like that?”
“Being a contractor?”
“Working for yourself.”
She paused again to consider, looking to the ceiling.  The coffee gurgled behind me.
“It’s hard work, and not as regular as I would like.  When a client comes along I have to work to show them I’m worth my rates.”  She smiled, more to herself than to me.  “Besides, I don’t play well with others.  That’s what makes me good at my job.”
“You seem perfectly nice to me,” I said.  I heard the coffee machine click off and turned to grab a cardboard cup with our stylized HDA logo.
“Why thank you, sugar, you’re too sweet.”
“What kind of a background to you need for that?” I asked as I poured out her cup.  There was no point in letting this pot cook for the next two hours, so I turned off the machine.
She laughed to herself before answering.
“I’m sure it’s probably something like a business or law degree, but I never got one.  An old friend of mine got me into it.  I was hooked after that very first job.  Thanks,” she said, taking the cup and holding it to her face with both hands.
“I also thought you might get chilly in that corner.”  I put my hand on the blanket I had set out.  “Would you like a blanket?”
Her eyebrows went up in surprise.
“That is so nice of you!  Thank you but not right now.”  She held up the cup.  “This will keep me warm enough.  Do you mind if I drink it back here?  I’m not ready to sit back down again.”
“Please do.  I’m just going to put this away,” I said, lifting the blanket.  She stepped back to let me get to the storage closet.
“How long have you been flying?”
I resumed my place, leaning against the galley counter.
“Six months.”
“Is that all?  You’re very professional.  It seems like you’ve been doing this for years.”
“Thank you.  My grandmother was a stewardess and she raised me.  I’ve been in training since I was a baby.”
“Tell her I said she’s doing a fine job.”  She smiled, but it faltered as she caught something in my expression.  I don’t have the mask that Pamela does.
“She would have loved to have heard that, thank you.”
“Oh, I’m so sorry, sweetie.”
An awkward beat passed when I regained my smile.  It hurt that she was gone, but I had meant what I said.  She’d have beamed to hear those words, and picturing her expression raised my spirits.
The woman spoke first.
“Before I sit down, I did have one more question.”
“You’re welcome back here as long as you’d like, but go on.”
“I have recently acquired a very unladylike vice,” she said, pointing to the Smoking section.  “Am I allowed while everyone is still sleeping, or do I need to wait until you turn the lights back on?”
“As long as you are discreet you should be fine.”
She nodded, taking the last pull on her coffee before handing the cup back to me.
“It was lovely talking with you, Lily.”
“It was mutual.”  I winked at her.  “I appreciate the company.”
I watched her walk up the aisle, digging in her purse as she did so.  She wasn’t watching where she was going and stumbled into one of the rows close to the curtain.  A man turned to face her and I had another gut-twisting moment of panic.  From his thick neck and salt and pepper hair I realized that it was Dearborn.  She made the exaggerated gesticulations of an apology and it looked like Dearborn waved her off.
She’d been lucky—I knew Dearborn was one of only a few people still awake.  It could have gotten ugly if she had woken someone up.
The curtain closed behind the woman and I grabbed for my sandwich, tearing into it.</Text>

            <Title>17: Names</Title>
            <Text>Names are a funny thing for flight attendants.
Actually, now that I say that out loud, let me be more clear.
Names are a funny thing for people in a service industry.  Be it flight attendant, bartender, waitress, or the girl slinging beer at baseball games.
Names are personal.  Using someone’s name is intimate.  Have you ever thought about the rules that go into calling someone by their name?
If you are good friends you call them by their nickname: Lily.
If you are acquaintances you call them by their full first name: Liliana.
If you don’t know someone at all, you call them by an honorific and their family name or names: Ms. Ramirez Alonso.
If you want to show respect when introducing one person to another, you might use an honorific and their given and family names: Ms. Liliana Ramirez Alonso.
If you’re in trouble you get called by your full name in a stern voice: Liliana Theresa Ramirez Alonso!
See the problem there?
The most intimate form of greeting, someone’s nickname, is what we have to wear on a badge pinned to our shirt all day.  Random people I don’t know use my nickname to get my attention.
Would the world end if my badge read “Ms. Alonso” instead?
Except, if you were paying attention, you know why that would never happen: honorific plus last name implies respect, or at least deference.  I’m not a cynical person, but I am enough of a realist to know that would be an inversion of power we’re not ready to accept.  Our culture isn’t prepared to treat the minimum-wage laborer bringing us our coffee as someone to be respected.
But I’m getting off track.  I was talking about how names are funny.
Names are also how we keep our professional distance.  Whether I’m behind a bar, wearing an apron, or pushing a drink cart, it’s always the same.  You don’t know me and I don’t know you, so what guides our interaction is the set of cultural standards of professionalism.  I don’t have to care about you.  I don’t have to think about how you’ve just had your third cup of coffee, or your third miniature bottle of gin, or your third plate of deep fried whatever, and what that’s going to do to you.
But the rules for names still apply.
If I know your family name then something changes.  I’m now addressing you, not some random customer or client.  When I think about what I’m going to say to you or about some other interaction I can hear your name in my head.  There’s a connection, however tenuous or imagined.
If I know your full name then there’s another level.  I now have your first name, which I will not use unless given permission, but I could.
When I tended bar I knew the names of two or three regulars.  It was a double-edged sword.  Each time I served them a drink I knew their names.  They were actual people with actual lives, and by participating in their lives I had a responsibility to be a good person to them.  On the rare occasion I had to cut off a regular, I used their name to demand their attention.  I was lucky, as it always worked.
On most of my flights I don’t bother to get to know anyone’s name.  I think of them in terms of their seat number: “the lady in 23B wants a pony”.  I’ll pick up a few names here or there as it makes conversation easier, just like how I first picked up Ms. Hamilton’s name from Terry.  I’ve always forgotten these ephemeral names by the next day.  In programmerese I might say that names are local and quickly go out of scope.
I got my hands on the manifest because that was no longer good enough.  If I’m going to keep track of the tiniest details of everyone around me on the absurd hope that something will stick out as helpful at the right time, I need to associate those details with something more concrete than a seat number.  I need names.
Tonight’s flight is completely full will 151 passengers.  I now have names for exactly seven of those people.  It’s not like I can just sit down and memorize a list of 151 names.  Not only is my memory not up to the task, but it would likely raise some eyebrows among the other crew members.
I have to do it a few names at a time.  I’ll absorb a handful each loop, presuming I’m going to be on this particular Ferris wheel a few more turns.
Each name will start to accrete a background, a context.  If there’s a bomber on board the only way I’ll find them is to understand why they’re doing it, which takes context.
Given enough context and enough time I’ll crack this puzzle, one name at a time.</Text>

            <Title>Flight Attendant (wikipedia)</Title>
            <Text>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant
The role of a flight attendant derives from that of similar positions on passenger ships or passenger trains, but it has more direct involvement with passengers because of the confined quarters on aircraft. Additionally, the job of a flight attendant revolves around safety to a much greater extent than those of similar staff on other forms of transportation. Flight attendants on board a flight collectively form a cabin crew, as distinguished from pilots and engineers in the cockpit.
Heinrich Kubis was the world's first flight attendant, in 1912.
Origins of the word "steward" in transportation are reflected in the term "chief steward" as used in maritime transport terminology. The term purser and chief steward are often used interchangeably describing personnel with similar duties among seafaring occupations. This lingual derivation results from the international British maritime tradition (i.e. chief mate) dating back to the 14th century and the civilian United States Merchant Marine on which US aviation is somewhat modeled. Due to international conventions and agreements, in which all ships' personnel who sail internationally are similarly documented by their respective countries, the U.S. Merchant Marine assigns such duties to the chief steward in the overall rank and command structure of which pursers are not positionally represented or rostered.
Imperial Airways of the United Kingdom had "cabin boys" or "stewards"; in the 1920s. In the US, Stout Airways was the first to employ stewards in 1926, working on Ford Trimotor planes between Detroit and Grand Rapids, Michigan. Western Airlines (1928) and Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) (1929) were the first US carriers to employ stewards to serve food. Ten-passenger Fokker aircraft used in the Caribbean had stewards in the era of gambling trips to Havana, Cuba from Key West, Florida. Lead flight attendants would in many instances also perform the role of purser, steward, or chief steward in modern aviation terminology.
The first female flight attendant was a 25-year-old registered nurse named Ellen Church. Hired by United Airlines in 1930, she also first envisioned nurses on aircraft. Other airlines followed suit, hiring nurses to serve as flight attendants, then called "stewardesses" or "air hostesses", on most of their flights. In the United States, the job was one of only a few in the 1930s to permit women, which, coupled with the Great Depression, led to large numbers of applicants for the few positions available. Two thousand women applied for just 43 positions offered by Transcontinental and Western Airlines in December 1935.
Female flight attendants rapidly replaced male ones, and by 1936, they had all but taken over the role. They were selected not only for their knowledge but also for their characteristics. A 1936 New York Times article described the requirements:
The girls who qualify for hostesses must be petite; weight 100 to 118 pounds; height 5 feet to 5 feet 4 inches; age 20 to 26 years. Add to that the rigid physical examination each must undergo four times every year, and you are assured of the bloom that goes with perfect health.
Three decades later, a 1966 New York Times classified ad for stewardesses at Eastern Airlines listed these requirements:
A high school graduate, single (widows and divorcees with no children considered), 20 years of age (girls 19 1/2 may apply for future consideration). 5'2" but no more than 5'9", weight 105 to 135 in proportion to height and have at least 20/40 vision without glasses.
In the United States, they were required to be unmarried and were fired if they decided to wed. The requirement to be a registered nurse on an American airline was relaxed as more women were hired, and it disappeared almost entirely during World War II as many nurses enlisted in the armed forces.
Ruth Carol Taylor was the first African-American flight attendant in the United States. Hired in December 1957, on February 11, 1958, Taylor was the flight attendant on a Mohawk Airlines flight from Ithaca to New York, the first time such a position had been held by an African American. She was let go within six months as a result of Mohawk's then-common marriage ban.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's first complainants were female flight attendants complaining of age discrimination, weight requirements, and bans on marriage. (Originally female flight attendants were fired if they reached age 32 or 35 depending on the airline, were fired if they exceeded weight regulations, and were required to be single upon hiring and fired if they got married.) In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants’ employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Also in 1968, the EEOC ruled that sex was not a bona fide occupational requirement to be a flight attendant. The restriction of hiring only women was lifted at all airlines in 1971 due to the decisive court case of Diaz vs. Pan Am. The no-marriage rule was eliminated throughout the US airline industry by the 1980s. The last such broad categorical discrimination, the weight restrictions, were relaxed in the 1990s through litigation and negotiations. Flight attendants still must usually have weight in proportion to height; persons outside the normal range may not be qualified to act as flight attendants.
The primary role of a flight attendant is to ensure passenger safety. In addition to this, flight attendants are often tasked with customer service duties such as serving meals and drinks, as a secondary responsibility.
The number of flight attendants required on flights are mandated by international safety regulations. For planes with up to 19 passenger seats, no flight attendant is needed. For larger planes, one flight attendant per 50 passenger seats is needed.
The majority of flight attendants for most airlines are female, though a substantial number of males have entered the industry since 1980.

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
         by A. Nonymous
                          CHAPTER ONE
                 Folder Names Become Subtitles
     Standard manuscript format is often required for novels
so that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors
to estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages
will be required to produce a book using the page size, style
and font used by their house. This PDF file was generated
using Scrivener's Compile feature and was created using the
"Novel" project template.
     Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate
title page. The author's name, address, telephone number and
e-mail address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the
title page, single-spaced. The title of the story should
appear in all-caps about half-way down the page. The author's
name follows the title on the by-line as the author wants it
to appear when published. A real name or pseudonym may be used
Surname / TITLE / 1
and may include initials, actual given name or professional
designation.
     All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with
a ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about
five spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional
blank line. (It used to be traditional to separate each
sentence with two spaces, but in these days of word processors
this is now less common.) A 12-point font such as Courier,
Times New Roman or Arial should be used throughout. In
Scrivener, however, you can write using any font and
formatting you choose - the "Formatting" pane of the Compile
sheet can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the "Novel" project template, the Compile
settings will deal with changing the font and formatting to
those required for standard manuscript format.
     Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header
comprising the author's real surname, the title of the work
(or a key word from the title) in capitals, and the page
number. In Scrivener, all of this is handled in the "Page
Settings" pane of the Compile sheet.
                               #
     Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do
Surname / TITLE / 2
not simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by
the typesetter. The "Separators" pane of Scrivener's Compile
sheet can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document.
     Indicate italics by underlining. In Scrivener, you can
use italics and set them to be converted to underlines upon
export or print by using "Convert italics to underlines" in
the "Transformations" pane of the Compile sheet.
Surname / TITLE / 3
￼￼
                          CHAPTER TWO
                    Another Chapter Folder
     Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the Compile settings.
The "Separators" pane of the Compile sheet can be set to start
a new page for each chapter folder, and the "Formatting" pane
can be used to add page padding at the top of the new page and
insert the chapter number (the latter using the "Level
Settings"). All of this has already been done for you in the
"Novel" project template.
     Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number
of words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will
happily accept a word processor word count these days. In
Scrivener, you can insert a word count of your manuscript by
Surname / TITLE / 4
using Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you
may wish to have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in
which case select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded
To Nearest 100--this feature is used on the title page of this
manuscript, in fact). Note that the actual word count will not
be inserted, but a tag that will be substituted for the word
count upon export. In reality, the formatting of a manuscript
is often only really crucial when submitting directly to a
publisher--first time novelists will usually submit to an
agent first, and agents are often less picky about format and
will point you in the right direction before submitting your
work to a publisher.

            <Text>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant
On most commercial airliners, flight attendants receive various forms of notification on board the aircraft in the form of audible chimes and colored lights above their stations. Typically, the following chimes and colors are used:
	• Pink or Red - Interphone calls from the cockpit to a flight attendant and/or interphone calls between two flight attendants (steady with high-low chime), or all services emergency call (flashing with repeated high-low chime).
	• Blue - Call from passenger in seat (steady with single high chime).
	• Amber - Call from passenger in lavatory (steady with single high chime), or lavatory smoke detector set off (flashing with repeated high chime).
	• Green (non-standard) - On some airlines' Airbus aircraft, this color is used to indicate interphone calls between two flight attendants, distinguishing them from the pink or red light used for interphone calls made from the cockpit to a flight attendant, and is also accompanied with a high-low chime like the pink or red light. On some other airlines' aircraft, this color has a completely different meaning, and is used to indicate that the cockpit is no longer sterile after the aircraft is above a specific altitude.

Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde /ˈkɒŋkɔrd/ is a turbojet-powered supersonic passenger jet airliner. It featured a maximum speed over twice the speed of sound at Mach 2.04, with seating for 92 to 128 passengers. First flown in 1969, Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued commercial flights for 27 years until 2003. It is one of only two supersonic transports to have entered commercial service; the other was the Tupolev Tu-144.

Concorde was jointly developed and produced by Aérospatiale and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) under an Anglo-French treaty. Concorde's name reflects the development agreement between the United Kingdom and France. In the UK, any or all of the type—unusually for an aircraft—are known simply as "Concorde", without an article. A total of 20 aircraft were built in France and the United Kingdom; six of these were prototypes and development aircraft. Seven each were delivered to Air France and British Airways. With only 20 aircraft built, the development of Concorde was a substantial economic loss; Air France and British Airways received considerable government subsidies to purchase them.

Among other destinations, Concorde flew regular transatlantic flights from London Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport to New York-JFK, Washington Dulles and Barbados; it flew these routes in less than half the time of other airliners. Over time the aircraft became profitable when it found a customer base willing to pay for flights on what was for most of its career the fastest commercial aircraft in the world. The aircraft is regarded by many people as an aviation icon and an engineering marvel.[5]

Concorde was retired in 2003 due to a general downturn in the aviation industry after the type's only crash in 2000, the 11 September terrorist attacks in 2001, and a decision by Airbus, the successor firm of Aérospatiale and BAC, to discontinue maintenance support.[6]

Commemorative gold medallion by Albert de Jaeger, of the intention to build Concorde
The origins of the Concorde project date to the early 1950s, when Arnold Hall, director of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) asked Morien Morgan to form a committee to study the supersonic transport (SST) concept. The group met for the first time in February 1954 and delivered their first report in April 1955.[7]

At the time it was known that the drag at supersonic speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing.[N 1] This led to the use of very short-span, very thin rectangular wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter or the Avro 730 that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.

This same short span produced very little lift at low speed, which resulted in extremely long takeoff runs and frighteningly high landing speeds.[8] In an SST design, this would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing runways, and to provide the fuel needed, "some horribly large aeroplanes" resulted.[9] Based on this, the group considered the concept of an SST unfeasible, and instead suggested continued low-level studies into supersonic aerodynamics.[9]

Soon after, Johanna Weber and Dietrich Küchemann at the RAE published a series of reports on a new wing planform, known in the UK as the "slender delta" concept.[10][11] The team, including Eric Maskell, worked with the fact that delta wings can produce strong vortexes on their upper surfaces at high angles of attack.[9] The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by Chuck Yeager in the Convair XF-92, but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity, and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance.[11][9]

Küchemann's and Weber's papers changed the entire nature of supersonic design almost overnight. Although the delta had already been used on aircraft prior to this point, these designs used planforms that were not much different from a swept wing of the same span.[N 2] Weber noted that the lift from the vortex was increased by the length of the wing it had to operate over, which suggested that the effect would be maximized by extending the wing along the fuselage as far as possible. Such a layout would still have good supersonic performance inherent to the short span, while also offering reasonable takeoff and landing speeds using vortex generation.[11] The only downside to such a design is that the aircraft would have to take off and land very "nose high" to generate the required vortex lift, which led to questions about the low speed handling qualities of such a design.[12] It would also need to have long landing gear to produce the required angles while still on the runway.

Küchemann presented the idea at a meeting where Morgan was also present. Test pilot Eric Brown recalls Morgan's reaction to the presentation, saying that he immediately seized on it as the solution to the SST problem. Brown considers this moment as being the true birth of the Concorde project.[12]


The HP.115 tested the low-speed performance of the slender delta layout.
On 1 October 1956 the Ministry of Supply asked Morgan to form a new study group, the Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee (STAC),[13] with the explicit goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, the decision was made to fund the development of a testbed aircraft to examine the low speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the Handley Page HP.115.[12] This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as 69 mph, about ⅓ that of the Starfighter.[14]

STAC stated that an SST would have economic performance similar to existing subsonic types.[9] Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, they would be able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time. STAC suggested that two designs naturally fell out of their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan suggested that a 150 passenger transatlantic SST would cost about £75 to £90 million to develop to production, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps £50 to £80 million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962.[9] Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.[15]

In 1959, a study contract was awarded to Hawker Siddeley and Bristol for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept,[16] which developed as the HSA.1000 and Bristol 198. Armstrong Whitworth also responded with an internal design, the M-Wing, for the lower-speed shorter-range category. Even at this early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959 Hawker approached Lockheed, and after the creation of British Aircraft Corporation in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with Boeing, General Dynamics, Douglas Aircraft and Sud Aviation.[16]

Küchemann and others at the RAE continued their work on the slender delta throughout, considering three basic shapes; the classic straight-edge delta, the "gothic delta" that was rounded outwards to appear like a gothic arch, and the "ogival wing" that was compound-rounded into the shape of an ogee. Each of these planforms had their own advantages and disadvantages in terms of aerodynamics. As they worked with these shapes, a practical concern grew to become so important that it forced selection of one of these designs.[17]

Generally one wants to have the wing's centre of pressure (CoP, or "lift point") close to the aircraft's centre of gravity (CoG, or "balance point") to reduce the amount of control force required to pitch the aircraft. As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase, it is common for the CoG to move fore or aft. With a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this.[N 3] With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CoG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.[17]

While the wing planform was evolving, so was the basic SST concept. Bristol's original Type 198 was a small design with an almost pure slender delta wing,[18] but evolved into the larger Type 223 with an ogival wing and canards as well.

By this time similar political and economic concerns in France had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud and Nord, as well as Dassault.[N 4] All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at Mach 3, the other two were jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.[19]

As soon as the design was complete, in April 1960, Pierre Satre, the company's technical director, was sent to Bristol to discuss a partnership. Bristol was surprised to find that the Sud team had designed a very similar aircraft after considering the SST problem and coming to the very same conclusions as the Bristol and STAC teams in terms of economics. It was later revealed that the original STAC report, marked "For UK Eyes Only", had secretly been passed to the French to win political favour. Sud made minor changes to the paper, and presented it as their own work.[20]

Unsurprisingly, the two teams found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already concluded they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic Caravelle).[21] As neither company had experience in the use of high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used – above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that Küchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one.[19]

The only disagreements were over the size and range. The UK team was still focused on a 150 passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while the French were deliberately avoiding these. However, this proved not to be the barrier it might seem; common components could be used in both designs, with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines, the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed.[22] The teams continued to meet through 1961, and by this time it was clear that the two aircraft would be considerably more similar in spite of different range and seating arrangements. A single design emerged that differed primarily in fuel load. More powerful Bristol Siddeley Olympus engines, being developed for the TSR-2, allowed either design to be powered by only four engines.[23]

While the development teams met, French Minister of Public Works and Transport Robert Buron was meeting with the UK Minister of Aviation Peter Thorneycroft, and Thorneycroft soon revealed to the cabinet that the French were much more serious about a partnership than any of the US companies.[24] The various US companies had proved uninterested in such a venture, likely due to the belief that the government would be funding development and would frown on any partnership with a European company, and the risk of "giving away" US technological leadership to a European partner.[16]

When the STAC plans were presented to the UK cabinet, a very negative reaction resulted. The economic considerations were considered highly questionable, especially as these were based on development costs, now estimated to be £150 million, which were repeatedly overrun in the industry. The Treasury Ministry in particular presented a very negative view, suggesting that there was no way the project would have any positive financial returns for the government, especially in light that "the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating (including the recent history of the TSR.2) suggests that it would be prudent to consider the £150 million [cost] to turn out much too low."[24]

This concern led to an independent review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered for the simple reason that everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.[24]

After considerable argument, the decision to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the European Common Market, which was being controlled by Charles de Gaulle who felt the UK's Special Relationship with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would pave the way for Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal.[25] It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.[25]

The development project was negotiated as an international treaty between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. A draft treaty was signed on 29 November 1962.[26]

Reflecting the treaty between the British and French governments that led to Concorde's construction, the name Concorde is from the French word concorde (IPA: [kɔ̃kɔʁd]), which has an English equivalent, concord. Both words mean agreement, harmony or union. The name was officially changed to Concord by Harold Macmillan in response to a perceived slight by Charles de Gaulle. At the French roll-out in Toulouse in late 1967,[27] the British Government Minister for Technology, Tony Benn, announced that he would change the spelling back to Concorde.[28] This created a nationalist uproar that died down when Benn stated that the suffixed 'e' represented "Excellence, England, Europe and Entente (Cordiale)." In his memoirs, he recounts a tale of a letter from an irate Scotsman claiming: "[Y]ou talk about 'E' for England, but part of it is made in Scotland." Given Scotland’s contribution of providing the nose cone for the aircraft, Benn replied, "[I]t was also 'E' for 'Écosse' (the French name for Scotland)  — and I might have added 'e' for extravagance and 'e' for escalation as well!"[29]

Concorde also acquired an unusual nomenclature for an aircraft. In common usage in the United Kingdom, the type is known as Concorde without an article, rather than the Concorde or a Concorde.[30][31]

At first the new consortium intended to produce one long-range and one short-range version. However, prospective customers showed no interest in the short-range version and it was dropped.[26]

An advertisement covering two full pages, promoting Concorde, ran in the 29 May 1967 issue of Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology. The advertisement predicted a market for 350 aircraft by 1980 and boasted of Concorde's head start over the United States' SST project.[32]

The consortium secured orders (i.e., non-binding options) for over 100 of the long-range version from the major airlines of the day: Pan Am, BOAC, and Air France were the launch customers, with six Concordes each. Other airlines in the order book included Panair do Brasil, Continental Airlines, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa, American Airlines, United Airlines, Air India, Air Canada, Braniff, Singapore Airlines, Iran Air, Olympic Airways, Qantas, CAAC, Middle East Airlines, and TWA.[26][33][34] At the time of the first flight the options list contained 74 options from 16 airlines:

The design work was supported by a preceding research programme studying the flight characteristics of low ratio delta wings. The supersonic BAC 221 was modified for flight tests of the high speed flight envelope,[36] the Handley Page HP.115 also provided valuable information on low speed performance.[37]

Construction of two prototypes began in February 1965: 001, built by Aerospatiale at Toulouse, and 002, by BAC at Filton, Bristol. Concorde 001 made its first test flight from Toulouse on 2 March 1969, piloted by André Turcat,[38] and first went supersonic on 1 October.[39] The first UK-built Concorde flew from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, piloted by Brian Trubshaw.[40][41] Both prototypes were presented to the public for the first time on 7–8 June 1969 at the Paris Air Show. As the flight programme progressed, 001 embarked on a sales and demonstration tour on 4 September 1971, which was also the first transatlantic crossing of Concorde.[42][43] Concorde 002 followed suit on 2 June 1972 with a tour of the Middle and Far East.[44] Concorde 002 made the first visit to the United States in 1973, landing at the new Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport to mark that airport’s opening.[45]


Concorde's first visit to Heathrow Airport on 1 July 1972
While Concorde had initially held a great deal of customer interest, the project was hit by a large number of order cancellations. The Paris Le Bourget air show crash of the competing Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 had shocked potential buyers, and public concern over the environmental issues presented by a supersonic aircraft – the sonic boom, takeoff-noise and pollution – had produced a shift in public opinion of SSTs. By 1976 four nations remained as prospective buyers: Britain, France, China, and Iran.[46] Only Air France and British Airways (the successor to BOAC) took up their orders, with the two governments taking a cut of any profits made.[47]

The United States cancelled the Boeing 2707, its rival supersonic transport programme, in 1971. Observers have suggested that opposition to Concorde on grounds of noise pollution had been encouraged by the United States Government, as it lacked its own competitor.[48] The US, India, and Malaysia all ruled out Concorde supersonic flights over the noise concern, although some of these restrictions were later relaxed.[49][50] Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon Concorde operations by President Jimmy Carter's administration as having been an act of protectionism of American aircraft manufacturers.[51] Concorde flew to an altitude of 68,000 ft (20,700 m) during a test flight in June 1973.[52][specify]

Concorde had other considerable difficulties that led to its dismal sales performance. Costs had spiralled during development to more than six times the original projections, arriving at a unit cost of £23 million in 1977.[53] World events had also dampened Concorde sales prospects, the 1973 oil crisis made many airlines think twice about aircraft with high fuel consumption rates; and new wide-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, had recently made subsonic aircraft significantly more efficient and presented a low-risk option for airlines.[54] While carrying a full load, Concorde achieved 15.8 passenger miles per gallon of fuel, while the Boeing 707 reached 33.3 pm/g, the Boeing 747 46.4 pm/g, and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 53.6 pm/g.[55] An emerging trend in the industry in favour of cheaper airline tickets had also caused airlines such as Qantas to question Concorde's market suitability.[56]


Concorde flight deck layout
Concorde is an ogival delta winged aircraft with four Olympus engines based on those employed in the RAF's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber. It is one of the few commercial aircraft to employ a tailless design (the Tupolev Tu-144 being another). Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) fly-by-wire flight-control system; the avionics system the Concorde used was unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits.[57] The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.[58]

Concorde pioneered the following technologies:

For high speed and optimisation of flight:

Double delta (ogee/ogival) shaped wings[10]
Variable engine air intake ramp system controlled by digital computers[59]
Supercruise capability[60]
Thrust-by-wire engines, predecessor of today’s FADEC-controlled engines[59]
Droop-nose section for better landing visibility
For weight-saving and enhanced performance:

Mach 2.04 (~2,179 km/h or 1,354 mph) cruising speed[61] for optimum fuel consumption (supersonic drag minimum although turbojet engines are more efficient at higher speed[62]) Fuel consumption at Mach 2.0 and at altitude of 60,000 feet (18,000 m) was 4,800 gallons per hour (22,000 L/h).[63]
Mainly aluminium construction for low weight and conventional manufacture (higher speeds would have ruled out aluminium)[64]
Full-regime autopilot and autothrottle[65] allowing "hands off" control of the aircraft from climb out to landing
Fully electrically controlled analogue fly-by-wire flight controls systems[57]
High-pressure hydraulic system of 28 MPa (4,000 lbf/in²) for lighter hydraulic components,[66] tripled independent systems ("Blue", "Green", and "Yellow") for redundancy, with an emergency ram air turbine (RAT) stored in the port-inner elevon jack fairing supplying "Green" and "Yellow" as backup.[67]
Complex Air data computer (ADC) for the automated monitoring and transmission of aerodynamic measurements (total pressure, static pressure, angle of attack, side-slip).[68]
Fully electrically controlled analogue brake-by-wire system[69]
Pitch trim by shifting fuel around the fuselage for centre-of-gravity (CofG) control at the approach to Mach 1 and above with no drag penalty.[70]
Parts made using "sculpture milling", reducing the part count while saving weight and adding strength.[71]
No auxiliary power unit, as Concorde would only visit large airports where ground air start carts are available.[72]

Concorde's intake ramp system schematics

Concorde's intake ramp system
Main article: Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593
Concorde needed to fly long distances to be economically viable; this required high efficiency. Turbofan engines were rejected due to their larger cross-section producing excessive drag. Turbojets were found to be the best choice of engines.[73] The engine used was the twin spool Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593, a development of the Bristol engine first used for the Avro Vulcan bomber, and developed into an afterburning supersonic variant for the BAC TSR-2 strike bomber.[74] Rolls-Royce's own engine proposed for the aircraft at the time of Concorde's initial design was the RB.169.[75]

The aircraft used reheat (afterburners) at takeoff and to pass through the upper transonic regime and to supersonic speeds, between Mach 0.95 and Mach 1.7. The afterburners were switched off at all other times.[76] Due to jet engines being highly inefficient at low speeds, Concorde burned two tonnes of fuel (almost 2% of the maximum fuel load) taxiing to the runway.[77] Fuel used is Jet A-1. Due to the high thrust produced even with the engines at idle, only the two outer engines were run after landing for easier taxiing.

The intake design for Concorde’s engines was especially critical.[78] The intakes had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures to be met in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternate path for excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdown.[79] The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.[80]

As well as supplying air to the engine the intake also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling nozzle. The nozzle ejector (or aerodynamic) design, with variable exit area and secondary flow from the intake, contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off to cruise.[81]

Engine failure causes problems on conventional subsonic aircraft; not only does the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank in the direction of the failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties.[82] During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero so, on Concorde, engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure.[83]

Concorde's Air Intake Control Units (AICUs) made use of a digital processor to provide the necessary accuracy for intake control. It was the world's first use of a digital processor to be given full authority control of an essential system in a passenger aircraft. It was developed by the Electronics and Space Systems (ESS) division of the British Aircraft Corporation after it became clear that the analogue AICUs fitted to the prototype aircraft and developed by Ultra Electronics were found to be insufficiently accurate for the tasks in hand.[citation needed]

Concorde's thrust-by-wire engine control system was developed by Ultra Electronics.[84]

Air compression on the outer surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch by the end of the flight.[85] Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft, due to aerodynamic heating, is the nose. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft due to its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was 127 °C (261 °F), which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02.[86] Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing.[87][88] The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.[89]

Owing to air compression in front of the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300 mm (almost 1 ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again.[90] To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning.[91] The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.[92]


Air France Concorde (F-BTSD) short-lived promotional Pepsi livery (April 1996)
Concorde had livery restrictions; the majority of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 degrees Celsius.[93] In 1996, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, with the exception of the wings, in a promotional deal with Pepsi.[94] In this paint scheme, Air France were advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.[95]


Fuel pitch trim
Due to its high speeds, large forces were applied to the aircraft during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which are attached to the stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed.[96] Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed.[59] This was visible from the rear passengers’ viewpoints.[97]

When any aircraft passes the critical mach of that particular airframe, the centre of pressure shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down force on the aircraft if the centre of mass remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift, but there was still a shift of about 2 metres. This could have been countered by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of mass, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.[98]

To fly non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean, Concorde required the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft. This was achieved by a combination of engines which were highly efficient at supersonic speeds,[N 5][59] a slender fuselage with high fineness ratio, and a complex wing shape for a high lift-to-drag ratio. This also required carrying only a modest payload and a high fuel capacity, and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag.[10][98]

Nevertheless, soon after Concorde began flying, a Concorde "B" model was designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with leading edge slats to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds, with the objective of expanding the range to reach markets in new regions.[99] It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy afterburner. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593.[100] This would have given 500 mi (805 km) additional range and a greater payload, making new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.[101]


External view of Concorde's fuselage

Concorde's high cruising altitude meant passengers received almost twice the flux of extraterrestrial ionising radiation as those travelling on a conventional long-haul flight.[102][103] Upon Concorde's introduction, it was speculated that this exposure during supersonic travels would increase the likelihood of skin cancer.[104] Due to the proportionally reduced flight time, the overall equivalent dose would normally be less than a conventional flight over the same distance.[105] Unusual solar activity might lead to an increase in incident radiation.[106] To prevent incidents of excessive radiation exposure, the flight deck had a radiometer and an instrument to measure the rate of decrease of radiation.[103] If the radiation level became too high, Concorde would descend below 47,000 feet (14,000 m).

Airliner cabins were usually maintained at a pressure equivalent to 6,000–8,000 feet (1,800–2,400 m) elevation. Concorde’s pressurisation was set to an altitude at the lower end of this range, 6,000 feet (1,800 m).[107] Concorde’s maximum cruising altitude was 60,000 feet (18,000 m); subsonic airliners typically cruise below 40,000 feet (12,000 m).

A sudden reduction in cabin pressure is hazardous to all passengers and crew.[108] Above 50,000 feet (15,000 m), a sudden cabin depressurisation would leave a "time of useful consciousness" up to 10–15 seconds for a conditioned athlete.[109] At Concorde’s altitude, the air density is very low; a breach of cabin integrity would result in a loss of pressure severe enough so that the plastic emergency oxygen masks installed on other passenger jets would not be effective and passengers would quickly suffer from hypoxia despite quickly donning them. Concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss in the event of a breach,[110] a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure, and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude. The FAA enforces minimum emergency descent rates for aircraft and noting Concorde’s higher operating altitude, concluded that the best response to pressure loss would be a rapid descent.[111] Continuous positive airway pressure would have delivered pressurised oxygen directly to the pilots through masks.[110]


Concorde performing a low-level flypast at an air show in August 1981
While subsonic commercial jets took eight hours to fly from New York to Paris, the average supersonic flight time on the transatlantic routes was just under 3.5 hours. Concorde had a maximum cruise altitude of 18,300 metres (60,039 ft) and an average cruise speed of Mach 2.02, about 1155 knots (2140 km/h or 1334 mph), more than twice the speed of conventional aircraft.[112]

With no other civil traffic operating at its cruising altitude of about 56,000 ft (17,000 m), dedicated oceanic airways or "tracks" were used by Concorde to cross the Atlantic. Due to the nature of high altitude winds, these SST tracks were fixed in terms of their co-ordinates, unlike the North Atlantic Tracks at lower altitudes whose co-ordinates alter daily according to forecast weather patterns (jetstreams).[113] Concorde would also be cleared in a 15,000-foot (4,600 m) block, allowing for a slow climb from 45,000 to 60,000 ft (18,000 m) during the oceanic crossing as the fuel load gradually decreased.[114] In regular service, Concorde employed an efficient cruise-climb flight profile following take-off.[115]

The delta-shaped wings required Concorde to adopt a higher angle of attack at low speeds than conventional aircraft, but it allowed the formation of large low pressure vortices over the entire upper wing surface, maintaining lift.[116] The normal landing speed was 170 miles per hour (274 km/h).[117] Because of this high angle, during a landing approach Concorde was on the "back side" of the drag force curve, where raising the nose would increase the rate of descent; the aircraft was thus largely flown on the throttle and was fitted with an autothrottle to reduce the pilot's workload.[118]

"The only thing that tells you that you're moving is that occasionally when you're flying over the subsonic aeroplanes you can see all these 747s 20,000 feet below you almost appearing to go backwards, I mean you are going 800 miles an hour or thereabouts faster than they are. The aeroplane was an absolute delight to fly, it handled beautifully. And remember we are talking about an aeroplane that was being designed in the late 1950s – mid 1960s. I think it's absolutely amazing and here we are, now in the 21st century, and it remains unique."

Concorde rear undercarriage

Tail bumper of Concorde G-BOAG at the Museum of Flight in Seattle
Because of the way Concorde's delta-wing generated lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually strong. At rotation, Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 knots indicated airspeed), this increased the stresses on the rear undercarriage in a way that was initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign.[120] Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels were added aft to prevent tailstrikes. The rear main undercarriage units swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also need to retract telescopically before swinging to clear each other when stowed.[121] The four main wheel tyres on each bogie unit are inflated to 232 lb/sq in. The twin-wheel nose undercarriage retracts forwards and its tyres are inflated to a pressure of 191 lb/sq in, and the wheel assembly carries a spray deflector to prevent standing water being thrown up into the engine intakes. The tyres are rated to 250 mph. The starboard nose wheel carries a single disc brake to halt wheel rotation during retraction of the undercarriage. The port nose wheel carries speed generators for the anti-skid braking system which prevents brake activation until nose and main wheels rotate at the same rate.

Additionally, due to the high average takeoff speed of 250 miles per hour (400 km/h), Concorde needed upgraded brakes. Like most airliners, Concorde has anti-skid braking – a system which prevents the tyres from losing traction when the brakes are applied for greater control during roll-out. The brakes, developed by Dunlop, were the first carbon-based brakes used on an airliner.[122] The use of carbon over equivalent steel brakes provided a weight-saving of 12,000 lb (5,443 kg).[123] Each wheel has multiple discs which are cooled by electric fans. Wheel sensors include brake overload, brake temperature, and tyre deflation. After a typical landing at Heathrow, brake temperatures were around 300-400 °C (572-752 °F).

Main article: Droop-nose
Concorde’s drooping nose, developed by Marshall Aerospace,[124] enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimum aerodynamic efficiency, and not obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, takeoff, and landing operations. Due to the high angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose was accompanied by a moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.[124]


Concorde landing at Farnborough in September 1974
A controller in the cockpit allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and takeoff. Following takeoff and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximum visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the five-degree position to avoid the possibility of damage.[124]

The Federal Aviation Administration had objected to the restrictive visibility of the visor used on the first two prototype Concordes and thus requiring alteration before the FAA would permit Concorde to serve US airports; this led to the redesigned visor used on the production and the four pre-production aircraft (101, 102, 201, and 202).[125] The nose window and visor glass needed to endure temperatures in excess of 100 °C (212 °F) at supersonic flight were developed by Triplex.[126]

Scheduled flights began on 21 January 1976 on the London–Bahrain and Paris–Rio (via Dakar) routes,[127] with BA flights using the "Speedbird Concorde" call sign to notify air traffic control of the aircraft’s unique abilities and restrictions, but the French using their normal call signs.[128] The Paris-Caracas route (via Azores) began on 10 April. The US Congress had just banned Concorde landings in the US, mainly due to citizen protest over sonic booms, preventing launch on the coveted North Atlantic routes. The US Secretary of Transportation, William Coleman, gave permission for Concorde service to Washington Dulles International Airport, and Air France and British Airways simultaneously began service to Dulles on 24 May 1976.[129]

When the US ban on JFK Concorde operations was lifted in February 1977, New York banned Concorde locally. The ban came to an end on 17 October 1977 when the Supreme Court of the United States declined to overturn a lower court’s ruling rejecting efforts by the Port Authority and a grass-roots campaign led by Carol Berman to continue the ban.[130] In spite of complaints about noise, the noise report noted that Air Force One, at the time a Boeing VC-137, was louder than Concorde at subsonic speeds and during takeoff and landing.[131] Scheduled service from Paris and London to New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport began on 22 November 1977.[132]

In 1977, British Airways and Singapore Airlines shared a Concorde for flights between London and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar via Bahrain. The aircraft, BA’s Concorde G-BOAD, was painted in Singapore Airlines livery on the port side and British Airways livery on the starboard side.[133][134] The service was discontinued after three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government;[135] it could only be reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian airspace in 1979. A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace, so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980.[136]

During the Mexican oil boom, Air France flew Concorde twice weekly to Mexico City’s Benito Juárez International Airport via Washington, DC, or New York City, from September 1978 to November 1982.[137][138] The worldwide economic crisis during that period resulted in this route’s cancellation; the last flights were almost empty. The routing between Washington or New York and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid creating a sonic boom over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to high speed while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, British Airways implemented changes to this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida to the east and south. Periodically Concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco.[139]

From 1978 to 1980, Braniff International Airways leased 10 Concordes, five each from Air France and British Airways.[140] These were used on subsonic flights between Dallas-Fort Worth and Washington Dulles International Airport, flown by Braniff flight crews.[141] Air France and British Airways crews then took over for the continuing supersonic flights to London and Paris.[142] The aircraft were registered in both the United States and their home countries; the European registration was covered while being operated by Braniff, retaining full AF/BA liveries. The flights were not profitable and typically less than 50% booked, forcing Braniff to end its tenure as the only US Concorde operator in May 1980.[143][144]

In its early years, the British Airways Concorde service had a greater number of "no shows" (passengers who booked a flight and then failed to appear at the gate for boarding) than any other aircraft in the fleet.[145]

Following the launch of British Airways' Concorde services, Britain's other major airline, British Caledonian (BCal), set up a task force headed by Gordon Davidson, BA's former Concorde director, to investigate the possibility of their own Concorde operations.[146][147][148] This was seen as particularly viable for the airline's long-haul network as there were two unsold aircraft then available for purchase.[149][150][151]

One important reason for BCal's interest in Concorde was that the British Government's 1976 aviation policy review had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence. To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans, as well as a partnership with BA.[152][153] BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network;[154][155] BCal's Concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route.[150][153][156]

BCal entered into a bid to acquire at least one Concorde.[149][151][156] However, BCal eventually arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and Aérospatiale respectively, to be maintained by either BA or Air France. BCal's envisaged two-Concorde fleet would have required a high level of aircraft utilisation to be cost-effective; therefore, BCal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a supersonic service between Gatwick and Atlanta, with a stopover at either Gander or Halifax.[150] Consideration was given to services to Houston and various points on its South American network at a later stage.[156][157] Both supersonic services were to be launched at some point during 1980; however, steeply rising oil prices caused by the 1979 energy crisis led to BCal shelving their supersonic ambitions.[153]


An Air France Concorde at John F. Kennedy International Airport in 1987
By around 1981 in the UK, the future for Concorde looked bleak. The British government had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In 1983, BA's managing director, Sir John King, convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to British Airways for £16.5 million plus the first year’s profits.[158][159]

King recognised that, in Concorde, BA had a premier product that was underpriced. Market research had revealed that many customers thought Concorde was more expensive than it actually was; thus ticket prices were progressively raised to match these perceptions.[59] It is reported that British Airways then ran Concorde at a profit, unlike their French counterpart.[160][161]

Between 1984 and 1991, British Airways flew a thrice-weekly Concorde service between London and Miami, stopping at Washington Dulles International Airport.[162][163] Until 2003, Air France and British Airways continued to operate the New York services daily. Concorde routinely flew to Grantley Adams International Airport, Barbados, during the winter holiday season.[164]

Prior to the Air France Paris crash, several UK and French tour operators operated charter flights to European destinations on a regular basis;[165][166] the charter business was viewed as lucrative by British Airways and Air France.[167]

In 1997, British Airways held a promotional contest to mark the 10th anniversary of the airline's move into the private sector. The promotion was a lottery to fly to New York held for 190 tickets valued at £5,400 each, to be offered at £10. Contestants had to call a special hotline to compete with up to 20 million people.[168]

Main article: Air France Flight 4590
On 25 July 2000, Air France Flight 4590, registration F-BTSC, crashed in Gonesse, France after departing from Paris-Charles de Gaulle en route to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, killing all 100 passengers and nine crew members on board the flight, and four people on the ground. It was the only fatal accident involving Concorde.

According to the official investigation conducted by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), the crash was caused by a metallic strip that fell from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off minutes earlier. This fragment punctured a tyre on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during takeoff. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a violent descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.[169]

On 6 December 2010, Continental Airlines and John Taylor, one of their mechanics, were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter,[170] but on 30 November 2012 a French court overturned the conviction, saying mistakes by Continental and Taylor did not make them criminally responsible.[171]

Prior to the accident, Concorde had been arguably the safest operational passenger airliner in the world in passenger deaths-per-kilometres travelled with zero, but had a rate of tyre damage some 30 times higher than subsonic airliners from 1995 to 2000.[172][173] Safety improvements were made in the wake of the crash, including more secure electrical controls, Kevlar lining on the fuel tanks and specially developed burst-resistant tyres.[174] The first flight with the modifications departed from London Heathrow on 17 July 2001, piloted by BA Chief Concorde Pilot Mike Bannister. During the 3-hour 20-minute flight over the mid-Atlantic towards Iceland, Bannister attained Mach 2.02 and 60,000 ft (18,000 m) before returning to RAF Brize Norton. The test flight, intended to resemble the London–New York route, was declared a success and was watched on live TV, and by crowds on the ground at both locations.[175]

The first flight with passengers after the accident took place on 11 September 2001, landing shortly before the World Trade Center attacks in the United States. This was not a revenue flight, as all the passengers were BA employees.[176] Normal commercial operations resumed on 7 November 2001 by BA and AF (aircraft G-BOAE and F-BTSD), with service to New York JFK, where passengers were welcomed by then mayor Rudy Giuliani.[177][178]


Concorde's final flight; G-BOAF from Heathrow to Bristol, on 26 November 2003. The extremely high fineness ratio of the fuselage is evident.
On 10 April 2003, Air France and British Airways simultaneously announced that they would retire Concorde later that year.[179] They cited low passenger numbers following the 25 July 2000 crash, the slump in air travel following the September 11, 2001 attacks, and rising maintenance costs. Although Concorde was technologically advanced when introduced in the 1970s, 30 years later, its analogue cockpit was dated. There had been little commercial pressure to upgrade Concorde due to a lack of competing aircraft, unlike other airliners of the same era such as the Boeing 747.[180] By its retirement, it was the last aircraft in British Airways' fleet that had a flight engineer; other aircraft, such as the modernised 747-400, had eliminated the role.[181]

On 11 April 2003, Virgin Atlantic founder Sir Richard Branson announced that the company was interested in purchasing British Airways’ Concorde fleet for their nominal original price of £1 (US$1.57 in April 2003) each.[182][183] British Airways dismissed the idea, prompting Virgin to increase their offer to £1 million each.[184][185] Branson claimed that when BA was privatised, a clause in the agreement required them to allow another British airline to operate Concorde if BA ceased to do so, but the Government denied the existence of such a clause.[186] In October 2003, Branson wrote in The Economist that his final offer was "over £5 million" and that he had intended to operate the fleet "for many years to come".[187] The chances for keeping Concorde in service were stifled by Airbus's lack of support for continued maintenance.[188][189][N 6]

It has been suggested that Concorde was not withdrawn for the reasons usually given but that it became apparent during the grounding of Concorde that the airlines could make more profit carrying first class passengers subsonically.[190] A lack of commitment to Concorde from Director of Engineering Alan MacDonald was cited as having undermined BA’s resolve to continue operating Concorde.[191]


Air France Concorde at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport

Air France Concorde in Auto &amp; Technik Museum Sinsheim
Air France made its final commercial Concorde landing in the United States in New York City from Paris on 30 May 2003.[192][193] Air France's final Concorde flight took place on 27 June 2003 when F-BVFC retired to Toulouse.[194]

An auction of Concorde parts and memorabilia for Air France was held at Christie's in Paris on 15 November 2003; 1,300 people attended, and several lots exceeded their predicted values.[195] French Concorde F-BVFC was retired to Toulouse and kept functional for a short time after the end of service, in case taxi runs were required in support of the French judicial enquiry into the 2000 crash.[196] The aircraft is now fully retired and no longer functional.[197]

French Concorde F-BTSD has been retired to the "Musée de l'Air" at Paris–Le Bourget Airport near Paris, unlike the other museum Concordes, a few of the systems are being kept functional. For instance, the famous "droop nose" can still be lowered and raised. This led to rumours that they could be prepared for future flights for special occasions.[198]

French Concorde F-BVFB currently rests at the Auto &amp; Technik Museum Sinsheim at Sinsheim, Germany, after its last flight from Paris to Baden-Baden, followed by a spectacular transport to Sinsheim via barge and road. The museum also has a Tupolev Tu-144 on display – this is the only place where both supersonic airliners can be seen together.[199]

In 1989, Air France signed a letter of agreement to donate a Concorde to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. upon the aircraft's retirement. On 12 June 2003, Air France honoured that agreement, donating Concorde F-BVFA (serial 205) to the Museum upon the completion of its last flight. This aircraft was the first Air France Concorde to open service to Rio de Janeiro, Washington, D.C., and New York and had flown 17,824 hours. It is on display at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles Airport.[citation needed]

BA Concorde G-BOAC in its hangar at Manchester Airport Aviation Viewing Park
British Airways conducted a North American farewell tour in October 2003. G-BOAG visited Toronto Pearson International Airport on 1 October, after which it flew to New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.[200] G-BOAD visited Boston’s Logan International Airport on 8 October, and G-BOAG visited Washington Dulles International Airport on 14 October.[201] It has been claimed that G-BOAD’s flight from London Heathrow to Boston set a transatlantic flight record of 3 hours, 5 minutes, 34 seconds.[202] However the fastest transatlantic flight was from New York JFK airport to Heathrow on 7 February 1996, taking 2 hours, 52 minutes, 59 seconds; 90 seconds less than a record set in April 1990.[203][204]

In a week of farewell flights around the United Kingdom, Concorde visited Birmingham on 20 October, Belfast on 21 October, Manchester on 22 October, Cardiff on 23 October, and Edinburgh on 24 October. Each day the aircraft made a return flight out and back into Heathrow to the cities, often overflying them at low altitude.[205][206][207] On 22 October, both Concorde flight BA9021C, a special from Manchester, and BA002 from New York landed simultaneously on both of Heathrow's runways. On 23 October 2003, the Queen consented to the illumination of Windsor Castle, an honour reserved for state events and visiting dignitaries, as Concorde's last west-bound commercial flight departed London.[208]

British Airways retired its Concorde fleet on 24 October 2003.[209] G-BOAG left New York to a fanfare similar to that given for Air France’s F-BTSD, while two more made round trips, G-BOAF over the Bay of Biscay, carrying VIP guests including former Concorde pilots, and G-BOAE to Edinburgh. The three aircraft then circled over London, having received special permission to fly at low altitude, before landing in sequence at Heathrow. The captain of the New York to London flight was Mike Bannister.[210] The final flight of a Concorde in the US occurred on 5 November 2003 when G-BOAG flew from New York's Kennedy Airport to Seattle's Boeing Field to join the Museum of Flight's permanent collection. The plane was piloted by Mike Bannister and Les Broadie who claimed a flight time of three hours, 55 minutes and 12 seconds, a record between the two cities.[211] The museum had been pursuing a Concorde for their collection since 1984.[212] The final flight of a Concorde world-wide took place on 26 November 2003 with a landing at Filton, Bristol, UK.[213]

All of BA's Concorde fleet have been grounded, drained of hydraulic fluid and their airworthiness certificates withdrawn. Jock Lowe, ex-chief Concorde pilot and manager of the fleet estimated in 2004 that it would cost £10–15 million to make G-BOAF airworthy again.[198] BA maintain ownership and have stated that they will not fly again due to a lack of support from Airbus.[214] On 1 December 2003, Bonhams held an auction of British Airways’ Concorde artifacts, including a nose cone, at Kensington Olympia in London.[215][216] Proceeds of around £750,000 were raised, with the majority going to charity. G-BOAD is currently on display at the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum in New York.[204] In 2007, BA announced that the advertising spot at Heathrow where a 40% scale model of Concorde was located would not be retained; the model is now on display at the Brooklands Museum.[217]

Although only used for spares after being retired from test flying and trials work in 1981, Concorde G-BBDG was dismantled and transported by road from Filton then restored from essentially a shell at the Brooklands Museum in Surrey.[218]

One of the youngest Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, it was announced that the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power.[219] In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations.[220] Save Concorde Group hoped to get F-BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics, but this never happened. The work for restoring F-BTSD to operating condition as of September 2015 is currently not very well known, and it is still being housed in Le Bourget as a museum exhibit. In 2015 the organisation Club Concorde announced that it had raised funds of £120 million for a static display[221] and to buy the Concorde at Le Bourget, restore it and return it to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and charter hire by 2019, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Concorde's first flight.[222]

In July 2015 it was reported that planning permission had been granted for the construction of the museum at Bristol Filton Airport to house G-BOAF the last Concorde where it is intended to form a key exhibit of the new Bristol Aviation Heritage Museum.[223]

In September 2015 it was publicly revealed [224] that the Concorde Club had secured over £160million to return an aircraft to service. [225]

Concorde Club president Paul James said: “The main obstacle to any Concorde project to date has been ‘Where’s the money?’ – a question we heard ad nauseam, until we found an investor. Now that money is no longer the problem it’s over to those who can help us make it happen.”[226] The organisation aims to buy the Concorde currently on display at Le Bourget airport. A tentative date of 2019 has been put forward for the first flight - 50 years after its maiden journey.[227] [228]

Tu-144FL as a research aircraft for NASA in 1997

Tu-144 and Concorde in Auto &amp; Technik Museum Sinsheim
The only supersonic airliner in direct competition with Concorde was the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144, nicknamed "Concordski" by Western European journalists for its outward similarity to Concorde.[229] It had been alleged that Soviet espionage efforts had resulted in the theft of Concorde blueprints, ostensibly to assist in the design of the Tu-144.[230] As a result of a rushed development programme, the first Tu-144 prototype was substantially different from the preproduction machines, but both were cruder than Concorde. The Tu-144S had a significantly shorter range than Concorde, due to its low-bypass turbofan engines.[231] The aircraft had poor control at low speeds because of a simpler supersonic wing design; in addition the Tu-144 required braking parachutes to land while Concorde used anti-lock brakes.[232] The Tu-144 had two crashes, one at the 1973 Paris Air Show,[233][234] and another during a pre-delivery test flight in May 1978.[235][236]

Later production Tu-144 versions were more refined and competitive. They had retractable canards for better low-speed control, turbojet engines providing nearly the fuel efficiency and range of Concorde[237] and a top speed of Mach 2.35. Passenger service commenced in November 1977, but after the 1978 crash the aircraft was taken out of service. The aircraft had an inherently unsafe structural design as a consequence of an automated production method chosen to simplify and speed up manufacturing.[238]

The American designs, the Boeing 2707 and the Lockheed L-2000, were to have been larger, with seating for up to 300 people.[239][240] Running a few years behind Concorde, the Boeing 2707 was redesigned to a cropped delta layout; the extra cost of these changes helped to kill the project.[241] The operation of US military aircraft such as the XB-70 Valkyrie and B-58 Hustler had shown that sonic booms were quite capable of reaching the ground,[242] and the experience from the Oklahoma City sonic boom tests led to the same environmental concerns that hindered the commercial success of Concorde. The American government cancelled the project in 1971, after having spent more than $1 billion.[243]

The only other large supersonic aircraft comparable to Concorde are strategic bombers, principally the Russian Tu-22, Tu-22M, M-50 (experimental), T-4 (experimental), Tu-160 and the American XB-70 (experimental), B-1.[citation needed]

Further information: Supersonic transport
Before Concorde’s flight trials, developments in the civil aviation industry were largely accepted by governments and their respective electorates. Opposition to Concorde’s noise, particularly on the east coast of the United States,[244][245] forged a new political agenda on both sides of the Atlantic, with scientists and technology experts across a multitude of industries beginning to take the environmental and social impact more seriously.[246][247] Although Concorde led directly to the introduction of a general noise abatement programme for aircraft flying out of John F. Kennedy Airport, many found that Concorde was quieter than expected,[59] partly due to the pilots temporarily throttling back their engines to reduce noise during overflight of residential areas.[248] Even before revenue flights started it had been claimed that Concorde was quieter than several aircraft then in service.[249] In 1971 BAC's technical director was quoted "It is certain on present evidence and calculations that in the airport context, production Concordes will be no worse than aircraft now in service and will in fact be better than many of them."[250]

Concorde produced nitrogen oxides in its exhaust, which, despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood to result in degradation to the ozone layer at the stratospheric altitudes it cruised.[251] It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible.[251] David W. Fahey, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found that to produce a drop in stratospheric ozone of 1 to 2% would require a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft to be operated. Dr. Fahey stated that this would not be a limiting factor for further supersonic transport development.[252]

Concorde’s technical leap forward boosted the public’s understanding of conflicts between technology and the environment as well as awareness of the complex decision analysis processes that surround such conflicts.[253] In France, the use of acoustic fencing alongside TGV tracks might not have been achieved without the 1970s controversy over aircraft noise.[254] In the UK, the CPRE has issued tranquillity maps since 1990.[255]

Some sources say Concorde typically flew 17 miles per U.S. gallon (14 L/100 km; 20 mpg-imp) per passenger (100 passengers were maximum capacity).[256]


Parade flight at Queen’s Golden Jubilee in June 2002
Concorde was normally perceived as a privilege of the rich, but special circular or one-way (with return by other flight or ship) charter flights were arranged to bring a trip within the means of moderately well-off enthusiasts.[257]

The aircraft was usually referred to by the British as simply "Concorde".[258] In France it was known as "le Concorde" due to "le", the definite article,[259] used in French grammar to introduce the name of a ship or aircraft,[260] and the capital being used to distinguish a proper name from a common noun of the same spelling.[259][261] In French, the common noun concorde means "agreement, harmony, or peace". [N 7] Concorde’s pilots and British Airways in official publications often refer to Concorde both in the singular and plural as "she" or "her".[263][264][N 8]

As a symbol of national pride, an example from the BA fleet made occasional flypasts at selected Royal events, major air shows and other special occasions, sometimes in formation with the Red Arrows.[265][266] On the final day of commercial service, public interest was so great that grandstands were erected at Heathrow Airport. Significant numbers of people attended the final landings; the event received widespread media coverage.[267]

In 2006, 37 years after its first test flight, Concorde was announced the winner of the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum. A total of 212,000 votes were cast with Concorde beating design icons such as the Mini, mini skirt, Jaguar E-type, Tube map and the Supermarine Spitfire.[5]


The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh disembark Concorde in 1991.
Heads of France and the United Kingdom flew Concorde many times.[268][269][270] Presidents Georges Pompidou,[271][272] Valéry Giscard d'Estaing[273][274][275][276] and François Mitterrand[277][278][279][280] regularly used Concorde as French flagman aircraft in foreign visits. Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Ministers Edward Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair took Concorde in some charter flights such as the Queen's trips to Barbados on her Silver Jubilee in 1977, in 1987 and in 2003, to Middle East in 1984, to the United States in 1991, etc.[281][281][282][283][284]

Pope John Paul II flew Concorde in May 1989.[285] Both the French President, as well as the British Prime Minister flew Concordes to San Juan for the second G-6 Economic Summit, held in the United States and hosted by President Gerald Ford at the Dorado Beach Hotel in Dorado, Puerto Rico on June 27–28, 1976.[citation needed]

Concorde sometimes made special flights for its demonstration, for exhibit on airshows (Farnborough, Paris-LeBourget, MAKS, etc.) and other expositions, for taking part in parades and celebrations (as ex., of Zürich airport anniversary in 1998), for private charters (as ex., many times by President of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko), for promo-advertising of companies (OKI, etc.), for Olympic torch relays (1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville), for observing of solar eclipse, etc.[286][287][288][289][290]

The fastest transatlantic airliner flight was from New York JFK to London Heathrow on 7 February 1996 by British Airways' G-BOAD in 2 hours, 52 minutes, 59 seconds from takeoff to touchdown aided by a 175 mph (282 km/h) tailwind.[291] On 13 February 1985, a Concorde charter flight flew from London Heathrow to Sydney—on the opposite side of the world—in a time of 17 hours, 3 minutes and 45 seconds, including refuelling stops.[292][293][294]

Concorde also set other records, including the official FAI "Westbound Around the World" and "Eastbound Around the World" world air speed records.[295] On 12–13 October 1992, in commemoration of the 500th anniversary of Columbus’ first New World landing, Concorde Spirit Tours (USA) chartered Air France Concorde F-BTSD and circumnavigated the world in 32 hours 49 minutes and 3 seconds, from Lisbon, Portugal, including six refuelling stops at Santo Domingo, Acapulco, Honolulu, Guam, Bangkok, and Bahrain.[296]

The eastbound record was set by the same Air France Concorde (F-BTSD) under charter to Concorde Spirit Tours[290] in the USA on 15–16 August 1995. This promotional flight circumnavigated the world from New York/JFK International Airport in 31 hours 27 minutes 49 seconds, including six refuelling stops at Toulouse, Dubai, Bangkok, Andersen AFB in Guam, Honolulu, and Acapulco.[297] By its 30th flight anniversary on 2 March 1999 Concorde had clocked up 920,000 flight hours, with more than 600,000 supersonic, many more than all of the other supersonic aircraft in the Western world combined.[298]

On its way to the Museum of Flight in November 2003, G-BOAG set a New York City-to-Seattle speed record of 3 hours, 55 minutes, and 12 seconds.[299]

Notes
Jump up ^ In particular, R. T. Jones' work at NACA demonstrated this in depth.
Jump up ^ Consider especially the English Electric Lightning, whose wing can be considered either a highly swept rectangle, or a delta with a notch cut out of the root.
Jump up ^ Or, more rarely, "bent" back into position. Examples include the Douglas DC-3 and Messerschmitt Me 262.
Jump up ^ This apparently took place some time in 1957, according to Conway's unclear statement about "the following year" which apparently references the first STAC meeting in late 1956.
Jump up ^ "It is the world's most efficient jet engine." -Ricky Bastin, Concorde Engineer[59]
Jump up ^ Quote: "Airbus, the manufacturer of Concorde, has said it is becoming uneconomic to maintain the ageing craft and that it will no longer provide spare parts for it."
Jump up ^ concorde s.f. concord, unity, harmony, peace.[262]
Jump up ^ Quote: Raymond Baxter commentating as Concorde flies for first time: "She rolls ... She flies!"
Jump up ^ BA and Air France Concordes originally had 100 seats. Due to weight considerations Air France removed 8 seats after the safety modifications of CY2000–2001.
